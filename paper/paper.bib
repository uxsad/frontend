Such harmful automated decision-making can be guarded against by ensuring AI systems are contestable by design: responsive to human intervention throughout the system lifecycle. Contestable AI by design is a small but growing field of research. However, most available knowledge requires a significant amount of translation to be applicable in practice. A proven way of conveying intermediate-level, generative design knowledge is in the form of frameworks. In this article we use qualitative-interpretative methods and visual mapping techniques to extract from the literature sociotechnical features and practices that contribute to contestable AI, and synthesize these into a design framework.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is one of the diseases that mostly affects older people without being a part of aging. The most common symptoms include problems with communicating and abstract thinking, as well as disorientation. It is important to detect Alzheimer's disease in early stages so that cognitive functioning would be improved by medication and training. In this paper, we propose two attention model networks for detecting Alzheimer's disease from MRI images to help early detection efforts at the preclinical stage. We also compare the performance of these two attention network models with a baseline model. Recently available OASIS-3 Longitudinal Neuroimaging, Clinical, and Cognitive Dataset is used to train, evaluate and compare our models. The novelty of this research resides in the fact that we aim to detect Alzheimer's disease when all the parameters, physical assessments, and clinical data state that the patient is healthy and showing no symptoms.},

These cycles also result in a tight coupling between the user and the system, making it impossible to study the system in isolation from the user. This necessitates an increased focus on studying how users can effectively influence the machine-learning system and how the learning system can appropriately influence the users. The following section examines how explicitly studying end users can challenge assumptions of traditional machine learning and better inform the development of interactive machine-learning systems. Many of the case studies to follow additionally consider less traditional types of input and output, moving beyond labeled examples and observations of learner predictions.},

Principles for human-AI interaction have been discussed in the human-computer interaction community for over two decades, but more study and innovation are needed in light of advances in AI and the growing uses of AI technologies in human-facing applications. We propose 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human-AI interaction. These guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products. The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge, highlighting opportunities for further research. Based on the evaluations, we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on the design of applications and features that harness AI technologies, and to researchers interested in the further development of human-AI interaction design principles.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTIn this article, we investigate human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) in an educational context where pupils used block-based programming in small groups to solve tasks given by the teacher. We used a design-based research approach in which we, together with the teachers, created a maker space for explorative science learning and organised teaching interventions wherein the pupils met online three hours a week for 16 weeks for an entire school year. Due to COVID-19, data were collected through Zoom, with collaborative learning situations captured through screen sharing and online communication using webcams. We employed three data analysis techniques: interaction analysis, visual artifact analysis, and thematic analysis. We developed an analytical framework for integration using thematic coding that combined concepts from computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) and domain-oriented design environments. We report the following findings: 1) Three types of rules between design units were identified with visual artifact analysis: latent, generic, and domain-specific rules; 2) two types of CSCL artifacts (technology and discussions) were intertwined and developed in parallel, along with a computer-based scaffolding scenario that offloads domain-specific scaffolding from humans to computers.},

  abstract = {The idea of conducting usability tests remotely emerged ten years ago. Since then, it has been studied empirically, and some software organizations employ remote methods. Yet there are still few comparisons involving more than one remote method. This paper presents results from a systematic empirical comparison of three methods for remote usability testing and a conventional laboratory-based think-aloud method. The three remote methods are a remote synchronous condition, where testing is conducted in real time but the test monitor is separated spatially from the test subjects, and two remote asynchronous conditions, where the test monitor and the test subjects are separated both spatially and temporally. The results show that the remote synchronous method is virtually equivalent to the conventional method. Thereby, it has the potential to conveniently involve broader user groups in usability testing and support new development approaches. The asynchronous methods are considerably more time-consuming for the test subjects and identify fewer usability problems, yet they may still be worthwhile.},

  abstract = {Predicting user engagement with direct displays (DD) is of paramount importance to commercial search engines, as well as to search performance evaluation. However, understanding within-content engagement on a web page is not a trivial task mainly because of two reasons: (1) engagement is subjective and different users may exhibit different behavioural patterns; (2) existing proxies of user engagement (e.g., clicks, dwell time) suffer from certain caveats, such as the well-known position bias, and are not as effective in discriminating between useful and non-useful components. In this paper, we conduct a crowdsourcing study and examine how users engage with a prominent web search engine component such as the knowledge module (KM) display. To this end, we collect and analyse more than 115k mouse cursor positions from 300 users, who perform a series of search tasks. Furthermore, we engineer a large number of meta-features which we use to predict different proxies of user engagement, including attention and usefulness. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is able to predict more accurately different levels of user engagement and outperform existing baselines.},

  abstract = {The efforts of addressing user experience (UX) in product development keep growing, as demonstrated by the proliferation of workshops and conferences bringing together academics and practitioners, who aim at creating interactive software able to satisfy their users. This special issue focuses on ``Interplay between User Experience Evaluation and Software Development'', stating that the gap between human-computer interaction and software engineering with regard to usability has somewhat been narrowed. Unfortunately, our experience shows that software development organizations perform few usability engineering activities or none at all. Several authors acknowledge that, in order to understand the reasons of the limited impact of usability engineering and UX methods, and to try to modify this situation, it is fundamental to thoroughly analyze current software development practices, involving practitioners and possibly working from inside the companies. This article contributes to this research line by reporting an experimental study conducted with software companies. The study has confirmed that still too many companies either neglect usability and UX, or do not properly consider them. Interesting problems emerged. This article gives suggestions on how they may be properly addressed, since their solution is the starting point for reducing the gap between research and practice of usability and UX. It also provides further evidence on the value of the research method, called Cooperative Method Development, based on the collaboration of researchers and practitioners in carrying out empirical research; it has been used in a step of the performed study and has revealed to be instrumental for showing practitioners why to improve their development processes and how to do so.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate how detailed tracking of user interaction can be monitored using standard web technologies. Our motivation is to enable implicit interaction and to ease usability evaluation of web applications outside the lab. To obtain meaningful statements on how users interact with a web application, the collected information needs to be more detailed and fine-grained than that provided by classical log files. We focus on tasks such as classifying the user with regard to computer usage proficiency or making a detailed assessment of how long it took users to fill in fields of a form. Additionally, it is important in the context of our work that usage tracking should not alter the user's experience and that it should work with existing server and browser setups. We present an implementation for detailed tracking of user actions on web pages. An HTTP proxy modifies HTML pages by adding JavaScript code before delivering them to the client. This JavaScript tracking code collects data about mouse movements, keyboard input and more. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in a case study.},

  abstract = {User trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems has been increasingly recognized and proven as a key element to fostering adoption. It has been suggested that AI-enabled systems must go beyond technical-centric approaches and towards embracing a more human-centric approach, a core principle of the human-computer interaction (HCI) field. This review aims to provide an overview of the user trust definitions, influencing factors, and measurement methods from 23 empirical studies to gather insight for future technical and design strategies, research, and initiatives to calibrate the user-AI relationship. The findings confirm that there is more than one way to define trust. Selecting the most appropriate trust definition to depict user trust in a specific context should be the focus instead of comparing definitions. User trust in AI-enabled systems is found to be influenced by three main themes, namely socio-ethical considerations, technical and design features, and user characteristics. User characteristics dominate the findings, reinforcing the importance of user involvement from development through to monitoring of AI-enabled systems. Different contexts and various characteristics of both the users and the systems are also found to influence user trust, highlighting the importance of selecting and tailoring features of the system according to the targeted user group's characteristics. Importantly, socio-ethical considerations can pave the way in making sure that the environment where user-AI interactions happen is sufficiently conducive to establish and maintain a trusted relationship. In measuring user trust, surveys are found to be the most common method followed by interviews and focus groups. In conclusion, user trust needs to be addressed directly in every context where AI-enabled systems are being used or discussed. In addition, calibrating the user-AI relationship requires finding the optimal balance that works for not only the user but also the system.},

A methodology is described which allows a rigorously disciplined approach to be made to software design.

Further, the self-documenting style improves the understanding of the program function. The introduction of an algorithm description language eases the transition from program specification to implemented code. The well formed structure imposed on the design reduces complexity. These factors are especially important when the implementation is at assembly level. Although this is applicable to all areas of software design, an elementary example of a graphics application has been used to illustrate the methodology.},

  abstract = {End-User Development (EUD), End-Programming (EUP) and End-User Software Engineering (EUSE) are three related research fields that study methods and techniques for empowering end users to modify and create digital artifacts. This paper presents a systematic mapping study aimed at identifying and classifying scientific literature about EUD, EUP and EUSE in the time range January 2000--May 2017. We selected 165 papers found through a manual selection of papers from specific conferences, journal special issues, and books, integrated with an automatic search on the most important digital libraries. The answer to our research question was built through a classification of the selected papers on seven dimensions: type of approach, interaction technique, phase in which the approach is adopted, application domain, target use, class of users, and type of evaluation. Our findings suggest that EUD, EUP and EUSE are active research topics not only in Human--Computer Interaction, but also in other research communities. However, little cross-fertilization exists among the three themes, as well as unifying frameworks and approaches for guiding novice designers and practitioners. Other findings highlight trends and gaps related to the analysis' dimensions, which have implications on the design of future tools and suggest open issues for further investigations.},

These phases rely on the study of several aspects of a sustainable digital transformation---among others: the domain of application, the work environment, and the ability of people to manage CT practices---and on the characterization of the EUD techniques that could be applied to support the modification, extension, and creation of digital artifacts.},

We argue that providing suitable tools to support End-User Development (EUD) in the workplace could represent a way to cope with such future changes. The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side.},

Central to this approach is the entity-grid representation of discourse, which captures patterns of entity distribution in a text. The algorithm introduced in the article automatically abstracts a text into a set of entity transition sequences and records distributional, syntactic, and referential information about discourse entities. We re-conceptualize coherence assessment as a learning task and show that our entity-based representation is well-suited for ranking-based generation and text classification tasks. Using the proposed representation, we achieve good performance on text ordering, summary coherence evaluation, and readability assessment.},

This work describes four studies, including a systematic literature review, with an overall sample of 141 participants in the survey (experts and novices), focus group sessions and testing of chatbots to (i) define attributes to assess the quality of interaction with chatbots and (ii) the designing and piloting a new scale to measure satisfaction after the experience with chatbots. Two instruments were developed: (i) A diagnostic tool in the form of a checklist (BOT-Check). This tool is a development of previous works which can be used reliably to check the quality of a chatbots experience in line with commonplace principles. (ii) A 15-item questionnaire (BOT Usability Scale, BUS-15) with estimated reliability between .76 and .87 distributed in five factors. BUS-15 strongly correlates with UMUX-LITE by enabling designers to consider a broader range of aspects usually not considered in satisfaction tools for non-conversational agents, e.g. conversational efficiency and accessibility, quality of the chatbot's functionality and so on. Despite the convincing psychometric properties, BUS-15 requires further testing and validation. Designers can use it as a tool to assess products, thus building independent databases for future evaluation of its reliability, validity and sensitivity.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates personalized voice characters for in-car speech interfaces. In particular, we report on how we designed different personalities for voice assistants and compared them in a real world driving study. Voice assistants have become important for a wide range of use cases, yet current interfaces are using the same style of auditory response in every situation, despite varying user needs and personalities. To close this gap, we designed four assistant personalities (Friend, Admirer, Aunt, and Butler) and compared them to a baseline (Default) in a between-subject study in real traffic conditions. Our results show higher likability and trust for assistants that correctly match the user's personality while we observed lower likability, trust, satisfaction, and usefulness for incorrectly matched personalities, each in comparison with the Default character. We discuss design aspects for voice assistants in different automotive use cases.},

The MICA (Mixed-Initiative Customization Assistance) system explores a middle ground between two opposing approaches to personalization: (1) an \&lt;em\&gt;adaptable \&lt;/em\&gt;approach, where personalization is fully user controlled and (2) and \&lt;em\&gt;adaptive \&lt;/em\&gt;approach, where personalization is fully system controlled. We overview MICA's strategy for providing user-adaptive recommendations to help users decide how to personalize their interfaces. In doing so, we focus primarily on how MICA handles threats to usability that are often found in adaptive interfaces including obtrusiveness and lack of understandability and control. We also describe how we evaluated MICA and highlight results from these evaluations.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used in image retrieval systems for medical decision making. One application of ML is to retrieve visually similar medical images from past patients (e.g. tissue from biopsies) to reference when making a medical decision with a new patient. However, no algorithm can perfectly capture an expert's ideal notion of similarity for every case: an image that is algorithmically determined to be similar may not be medically relevant to a doctor's specific diagnostic needs. In this paper, we identified the needs of pathologists when searching for similar images retrieved using a deep learning algorithm, and developed tools that empower users to cope with the search algorithm on-the-fly, communicating what types of similarity are most important at different moments in time. In two evaluations with pathologists, we found that these tools increased the diagnostic utility of images found and increased user trust in the algorithm. The tools were preferred over a traditional interface, without a loss in diagnostic accuracy. We also observed that users adopted new strategies when using refinement tools, re-purposing them to test and understand the underlying algorithm and to disambiguate ML errors from their own errors. Taken together, these findings inform future human-ML collaborative systems for expert decision-making.},

While AI systems have largely been driven by a technology-centered design approach, the potential societal consequences of AI have mobilized both HCI and AI researchers towards researching human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI). However, there remains considerable ambiguity about what it means to frame, design and evaluate HCAI. This paper presents a critical review of the large corpus of peer-reviewed literature emerging on HCAI in order to characterize what the community is defining as HCAI. Our review contributes an overview and map of HCAI research based on work that explicitly mentions the terms `human-centered artificial intelligence' or `human-centered machine learning' or their variations, and suggests future challenges and research directions. The map reveals the breadth of research happening in HCAI, established clusters and the emerging areas of Interaction with AI and Ethical AI. The paper contributes a new definition of HCAI, and calls for greater collaboration between AI and HCI research, and new HCAI constructs.},

  abstract = {Chatbots are computer programs aiming to replicate human conversational abilities through voice exchanges, textual dialogues, or both. They are becoming increasingly pervasive in many domains like customer support, e-coaching or entertainment. Yet, there is no standardised way of measuring the quality of such virtual agents. Instead, multiple individuals and groups have established their own standards either specifically for their chatbot project or have taken some inspiration from other groups. In this paper, we make a review of current techniques and trends in chatbot evaluation. We examine chatbot evaluation methodologies and assess them according to the ISO 9214 concepts of usability: Effectiveness, Efficiency and Satisfaction. We then analyse the methods used in the literature from 2016 to 2020 and compare their results. We identify a clear trend towards evaluating the efficiency of chatbots in many recent papers, which we link to the growing popularity of task-based chatbots that are currently being deployed in many business contexts.},

  abstract = {Dementia is one of the most common diseases in the elderly and a leading cause of mortality and disability. In recent years, a research effort has been made to develop computer aided diagnosis tools based on machine (deep) learning models fed with neuroimaging data. However, while much work has been done on MRI imaging, very little attention has been paid on amyloid PETs, which have been recently recognized to be a promising and powerful biomarker of neurodegeneration. In this paper, we contribute to this less explored research area by proposing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network aimed at detecting dementia based on amyloid PET scans. An experiment performed on the recently released OASIS-3 dataset, which provides the community with a new benchmark to advance this line of research further, yielded very promising results and provided new evidence on the effectiveness of amyloid PET.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning and imaging technologies have revolutionized automated medical image analysis, especially in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease through neuroimaging. Despite the availability of various imaging modalities for the same patient, the development of multi-modal models leveraging these modalities remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing and evaluating classification models using 2D and 3D MRI images and amyloid PET scans in uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks. Our findings demonstrate that models using volumetric data learn more effective representations than those using only 2D images. Furthermore, integrating multiple modalities enhances model performance over single-modality approaches significantly. We achieved state-of-the-art performance on the OASIS-3 cohort. Additionally, explainability analyses with Grad-CAM indicate that our model focuses on crucial AD-related regions for its predictions, underscoring its potential to aid in understanding the disease's causes.},

  abstract = {Existing eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques support people in interpreting AI advice. However, while previous work evaluates the users' understanding of explanations, factors influencing the decision support are largely overlooked in the literature. This paper addresses this gap by studying the impact of user uncertainty, AI correctness, and the interaction between AI uncertainty and explanation logic-styles, for classification tasks. We conducted two separate studies: one requesting participants to recognise hand-written digits and one to classify the sentiment of reviews. To assess the decision making, we analysed the task performance, agreement with the AI suggestion, and the user's reliance on the XAI interface elements. Participants make their decision relying on three pieces of information in the XAI interface (image or text instance, AI prediction, and explanation). Participants were shown one explanation style (between-participants design): according to three styles of logical reasoning (inductive, deductive, and abductive). This allowed us to study how different levels of AI uncertainty influence the effectiveness of different explanation styles. The results show that user uncertainty and AI correctness on predictions significantly affected users' classification decisions considering the analysed metrics. In both domains (images and text), users relied mainly on the instance to decide. Users were usually overconfident about their choices, and this evidence was more pronounced for text. Furthermore, the inductive style explanations led to over-reliance on the AI advice in both domains -- it was the most persuasive, even when the AI was incorrect. The abductive and deductive styles have complex effects depending on the domain and the AI uncertainty levels.},

  abstract = {A common criteria for Explainable AI (XAI) is to support users in establishing appropriate trust in the AI -- rejecting advice when it is incorrect, and accepting advice when it is correct. Previous findings suggest that explanations can cause an over-reliance on AI (overly accepting advice). Explanations that evoke appropriate trust are even more challenging for decision-making tasks that are difficult for humans and AI. For this reason, we study decision-making by non-experts in the high-uncertainty domain of stock trading. We compare the effectiveness of three different explanation styles (influenced by inductive, abductive, and deductive reasoning) and the role of AI confidence in terms of a) the users' reliance on the XAI interface elements (charts with indicators, AI prediction, explanation), b) the correctness of the decision (task performance), and c) the agreement with the AI's prediction. In contrast to previous work, we look at interactions between different aspects of decision-making, including AI correctness, and the combined effects of AI confidence and explanations styles. Our results show that specific explanation styles (abductive and deductive) improve the user's task performance in the case of high AI confidence compared to inductive explanations. In other words, these styles of explanations were able to invoke correct decisions (for both positive and negative decisions) when the system was certain. In such a condition, the agreement between the user's decision and the AI prediction confirms this finding, highlighting a significant agreement increase when the AI is correct. This suggests that both explanation styles are suitable for evoking appropriate trust in a confident AI. Our findings further indicate a need to consider AI confidence as a criterion for including or excluding explanations from AI interfaces. In addition, this paper highlights the importance of carefully selecting an explanation style according to the characteristics of the task and data.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review               Artificial intelligence has become popular in medical applications, specifically as a clinical support tool for computer-aided diagnosis. These tools are typically employed on medical data (i.e., image, molecular data, clinical variables, etc.) and used the statistical and machine-learning methods to measure the model performance. In this review, we summarized and discussed the most recent radiomic pipeline used for clinical analysis.                                         Recent findings               Currently, limited management of cancers benefits from artificial intelligence, mostly related to a computer-aided diagnosis that avoids a biopsy analysis that presents additional risks and costs. Most artificial intelligence tools are based on imaging features, known as radiomic analysis that can be refined into predictive models in noninvasively acquired imaging data. This review explores the progress of artificial intelligence-based radiomic tools for clinical applications with a brief description of necessary technical steps. Explaining new radiomic approaches based on deep-learning techniques will explain how the new radiomic models (deep radiomic analysis) can benefit from deep convolutional neural networks and be applied on limited data sets.                                         Summary               To consider the radiomic algorithms, further investigations are recommended to involve deep learning in radiomic models with additional validation steps on various cancer types.},

AI holds great promise in terms of beneficial, accurate and effective preventive and curative interventions. At the same time, there is also concerns regarding potential risks, harm and trust issues arising from the opacity of some AI algorithms because of their un-explainability. Overall, how can the decisions from these AI-based systems be trusted if the decision-making logic cannot be properly explained?

  abstract = {Summary             Research in artificial intelligence for radiology and radiotherapy has recently become increasingly reliant on the use of deep learning-based algorithms. While the performance of the models which these algorithms produce can significantly outperform more traditional machine learning methods, they do rely on larger datasets being available for training. To address this issue, data augmentation has become a popular method for increasing the size of a training dataset, particularly in fields where large datasets aren't typically available, which is often the case when working with medical images. Data augmentation aims to generate additional data which is used to train the model and has been shown to improve performance when validated on a separate unseen dataset. This approach has become commonplace so to help understand the types of data augmentation techniques used in state-of-the-art deep learning models, we conducted a systematic review of the literature where data augmentation was utilised on medical images (limited to CT and MRI) to train a deep learning model. Articles were categorised into basic, deformable, deep learning or other data augmentation techniques. As artificial intelligence models trained using augmented data make their way into the clinic, this review aims to give an insight to these techniques and confidence in the validity of the models produced.},

Although the social sciences suggest that explanation is a social and iterative process between an explainer and an explainee, explanation user interfaces and their user interactions have not been systematically explored in XAI research yet. Therefore, we review prior XAI research containing explanation user interfaces for ML-based intelligent systems and describe different concepts of interaction. Further, we present observed design principles for interactive explanation user interfaces. With our work, we inform designers of XAI systems about human-centric ways to tailor their explanation user interfaces to different target audiences and use cases.},

  abstract = {Conversational agents promise conversational interaction but fail to deliver. Efforts often emulate functional rules from human speech, without considering key characteristics that conversation must encapsulate. Given its potential in supporting long-term human-agent relationships, it is paramount that HCI focuses efforts on delivering this promise. We aim to understand what people value in conversation and how this should manifest in agents. Findings from a series of semi-structured interviews show people make a clear dichotomy between social and functional roles of conversation, emphasising the long-term dynamics of bond and trust along with the importance of context and relationship stage in the types of conversations they have. People fundamentally questioned the need for bond and common ground in agent communication, shifting to more utilitarian definitions of conversational qualities. Drawing on these findings we discuss key challenges for conversational agent design, most notably the need to redefine the design parameters for conversational agent interaction.},

This position paper brings together seven researchers working in the field with different roles and perspectives, to explore in depth the concept of explainable AI, or XAI, offering a functional definition and conceptual framework or model that can be used when considering XAI.

Such issues concern all stakeholders involved in or committed to the design, implementation, deployment, and use of the technology. The present document addresses these preoccupations by introducing and discussing a set of practical obligations and recommendations for the development of applications and systems based on AI techniques. With this work we hope to contribute to spreading awareness on the many social challenges posed by AI and encouraging the establishment of good practices throughout the relevant social areas. As points of novelty, the paper elaborates on an integrated view that combines both human rights and ethical concepts to reap the benefits of the two approaches. Moreover, it proposes innovative recommendations, such as those on redress and governance, which add further insight to the debate. Finally, it incorporates a specific focus on the Italian Constitution, thus offering an example of how core legislations of Member States might contribute to further specify and enrich the EU normative framework on AI.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTNowadays, end users can exploit end-user development (EUD) platforms to personalise their Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems, typically through trigger?action rules. Unfortunately, within such platforms, users are forced to adopt a unique, vendor-centric abstraction: to define triggers and actions, they must specifically refer to every single device or online service needed to execute the intended behaviours. As a consequence, little social and practical benefits of EUD in this domain have emerged so far. In this paper, we build on the idea that other abstractions besides the vendor-centric one are possible, and that the growth of end-user personalisation in the IoT may depend on their identification. Specifically, we report on the results of a 1-week-long diary study during which 24 participants were free to collect trigger?action rules arising during their daily activities. First, we demonstrate that users would adopt different abstractions by personalising devices, information and people-related behaviours, where the individual is at the centre of the interaction. Then, we show that the adopted abstraction may depend on different factors, ranging from the user profile, e.g. their programming experience, to the context in which the personalisation is introduced. While users are inclined to personalise physical objects in the home, for example, they often go ?beyond devices? in the city, where they are more interested in the underlying information. Finally, we discuss the retrieved results by identifying new design opportunities to improve the relationship between users and the IoT.},

  abstract = {Robots are becoming interactive and robust enough to be adopted outside laboratories and in industrial scenarios as well as interacting with humans in social activities. However, the design of engaging robot-based applications requires the availability of usable, flexible and accessible development frameworks, which can be adopted and mastered by researchers and practitioners in social sciences and adult end users as a whole. This paper surveys Visual Programming Environments aimed at enabling a paradigm fostering the so-called End-User Development of applications involving robots with social capabilities. The focus of this article is on those Visual Programming Environments that are designed to support social research goals as well as to cater for professional needs of people not trained in more traditional text-based computer programming languages. This survey excludes interfaces aimed at supporting expert programmers, at allowing industrial robots to perform typical industrial tasks (such as pick and place operations), and at teaching children how to code. After having performed a systematic search, sixteen programming environments have been included in this survey. Our goal is two-fold: first, to present these software tools with their technical features and Authoring Artificial Intelligence modeling approaches, and second, to present open challenges in the development of Visual Programming Environments for end users and social researchers, which can be informative and valuable to the community. The results show that the most recent such tools are adopting distributed and Component-Based Software Engineering approaches and web technologies. However, few of them have been designed to enable the independence of end users from high-tech scribes. Moreover, findings indicate the need for (i) more objective and comparative evaluations, as well as usability and user experience studies with real end users; and (ii) validations of these tools for designing applications aimed at working ``in-the-wild'' rather than only in laboratories and structured settings.},

Previous research has studied the experiences of frequent IPA users. Using qualitative methods we explore the experience of infrequent users: people who have tried IPAs, but choose not to use them regularly. Unsurprisingly infrequent users share some of the experiences of frequent users, e.g. frustration at limitations on fully hands-free interaction. Significant points of contrast and previously unidentified concerns also emerge. Cultural norms and social embarrassment take on added significance for infrequent users. Humanness of IPAs sparked comparisons with human assistants, juxtaposing their limitations. Most importantly, significant concerns emerged around privacy, monetization, data permanency and transparency. Drawing on these findings we discuss key challenges, including: designing for interruptability; reconsideration of the human metaphor; issues of trust and data ownership. Addressing these challenges may lead to more widespread IPA use.},

Objective               We sought to identify current frameworks guiding the application and evaluation of AI for predictive analytics in medicine and to describe the content of these frameworks. We also assessed what stages along the AI translational spectrum (ie, AI development, reporting, evaluation, implementation, and surveillance) the content of each framework has been discussed.                                         Methods               We performed a literature review of frameworks regarding the oversight of AI in medicine. The search included key topics such as ``artificial intelligence,'' ``machine learning,'' ``guidance as topic,'' and ``translational science,'' and spanned the time period 2014-2022. Documents were included if they provided generalizable guidance regarding the use or evaluation of AI in medicine. Included frameworks are summarized descriptively and were subjected to content analysis. A novel evaluation matrix was developed and applied to appraise the frameworks' coverage of content areas across translational stages.                                         Results               Fourteen frameworks are featured in the review, including six frameworks that provide descriptive guidance and eight that provide reporting checklists for medical applications of AI. Content analysis revealed five considerations related to the oversight of AI in medicine across frameworks: transparency, reproducibility, ethics, effectiveness, and engagement. All frameworks include discussions regarding transparency, reproducibility, ethics, and effectiveness, while only half of the frameworks discuss engagement. The evaluation matrix revealed that frameworks were most likely to report AI considerations for the translational stage of development and were least likely to report considerations for the translational stage of surveillance.                                         Conclusions               Existing frameworks for the application and evaluation of AI in medicine notably offer less input on the role of engagement in oversight and regarding the translational stage of surveillance. Identifying and optimizing strategies for engagement are essential to ensure that AI can meaningfully benefit patients and other end users.},

We present findings from an experiment using a Wizard-of-Oz-backed recreation of a voice assistant-based designer; participants describe a holiday ornament of their own imagination to the voice assistant, which elicits details and offers design choices before ultimately ``creating'' the ornament for the participant. For 8 out of 16 participants, a video channel allows the participant to see the designed object as it is iteratively designed and refined. We offer observations about the nature of the interactions between participants and the voice assistant, as well as quantitative measures of participant-reported cognitive load and predicted and actual satisfaction and accuracy of reproduction. Participants report greater satisfaction with their ornaments and experience reduced cognitive load if they can see them being designed; their expectations are higher if they cannot. 15 of 16 participants would use a voice assistant again for a design task.},

  abstract = {One key technique people use in conversation and collaboration is conversational repair. Self-repair is the recognition and attempted correction of one's own mistakes. We investigate how the self-repair of errors by intelligent voice assistants affects user interaction. In a controlled human-participant study (N =101), participants asked Amazon Alexa to perform four tasks, and we manipulated whether Alexa would "make a mistake'' understanding the participant (for example, playing heavy metal in response to a request for relaxing music) and whether Alexa would perform a correction (for example, stating, "You don't seem pleased. Did I get that wrong?'') We measured the impact of self-repair on the participant's perception of the interaction in four conditions: correction (mistakes made and repair performed), undercorrection (mistakes made, no repair performed), overcorrection (no mistakes made, but repair performed), and control (no mistakes made, and no repair performed). Subsequently, we conducted free-response interviews with each participant about their interactions. This study finds that self-repair greatly improves people's assessment of an intelligent voice assistant if a mistake has been made, but can degrade assessment if no correction is needed. However, we find that the positive impact of self-repair in the wake of an error outweighs the negative impact of overcorrection. In addition, participants who recently experienced an error saw increased value in self-repair as a feature, regardless of whether they experienced a repair themselves.},

Brain tumors are specifically hard to diagnose and treat because of the complexity of the organ in which they develop. Detecting them in time can lower the chances of death and facilitate the therapy process for patients. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, more specifically, deep learning, has the potential to significantly reduce costs in terms of time and resources for the discovery and identification of tumors from images obtained through imaging techniques. This research work aims to assess the performance of a multimodal model for the classification of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans processed as grayscale images. The results are promising, and in line with similar works, as the model reaches an accuracy of around 99\%. We also highlight the need for explainability and transparency to ensure human control and safety.},

Despite the importance of critical thinking, research reveals that our reasoning ability suffers from personal biases and cognitive resource limitations, leading to potentially dangerous outcomes. This paper presents the novel idea of AI-framed Questioning that turns information relevant to the AI classification into questions to actively engage users' thinking and scaffold their reasoning process. We conducted a study with 204 participants comparing the effects of AI-framed Questioning on a critical thinking task; discernment of logical validity of socially divisive statements. Our results show that compared to no feedback and even causal AI explanations of an always correct system, AI-framed Questioning significantly increase human discernment of logically flawed statements. Our experiment exemplifies a future style of Human-AI co-reasoning system, where the AI becomes a critical thinking stimulator rather than an information teller.},

  abstract = {We present a novel approach to automatically segment magnetic resonance (MR) images of the human brain into anatomical regions. Our methodology is based on a deep artificial neural network that assigns each voxel in an MR image of the brain to its corresponding anatomical region. The inputs of the network capture information at different scales around the voxel of interest: 3D and orthogonal 2D intensity patches capture a local spatial context while downscaled large 2D orthogonal patches and distances to the regional centroids enforce global spatial consistency. Contrary to commonly used segmentation methods, our technique does not require any non-linear registration of the MR images. To benchmark our model, we used the dataset provided for the MICCAI 2012 challenge on multi-atlas labelling, which consists of 35 manually segmented MR images of the brain. We obtained competitive results (mean dice coefficient 0.725, error rate 0.163) showing the potential of our approach. To our knowledge, our technique is the first to tackle the anatomical segmentation of the whole brain using deep neural networks.},

IoT devices, so-called smart objects, are becoming even more pervasive and social, leading to the need to provide non-technical users with innovative interaction strategies for controlling their behavior. In other words, the opportunities offered by IoT can be amplified if new approaches are conceived to enable non-technical users to be directly involved in ``composing'' their smart objects by synchronizing their behavior. To fulfill this goal, this article introduces a model that includes new operators for defining rules combining multiple events and conditions exposed by smart objects, and for defining temporal and spatial constraints on rule activation. The article also presents the results of an elicitation study that was conducted to identify possible visual paradigms for expressing composition rules. Prototypes implementing the resulting visual paradigms were compared during a controlled experiment and the one that resulted most relevant for our goals was used in a study that involved home-automation experts. Finally, the article discusses some design implications that came out from the performed studies and presents the architecture of a platform supporting rule definition and execution.},

  abstract = {Manufacturing tools like 3D printers have become accessible to the wider society, making the promise of digital fabrication for everyone seemingly reachable. While the actual manufacturing process is largely automated today, users still require knowledge of complex design applications to produce ready-designed objects and adapt them to their needs or design new objects from scratch. To lower the barrier to the design and customization of personalized 3D models, we explored novice mental models in voice-based 3D modeling by conducting a high-fidelity Wizard of Oz study with 22 participants. We performed a thematic analysis of the collected data to understand how the mental model of novices translates into voice-based 3D modeling. We conclude with design implications for voice assistants. For example, they have to: deal with vague, incomplete and wrong commands; provide a set of straightforward commands to shape simple and composite objects; and offer different strategies to select 3D objects.},

It presents a human-AI inter- action paradigm that emphasizes explainability and user control of AI systems.

This interaction paradigm is exploited in the redesign of an existing AI-based tool for microscopic analysis of the nasal mucosa. The resulting tool is tested with rhinocytologists. The article discusses the analysis of the results of the conducted evaluation and outlines lessons learned that are relevant for AI in medicine.},

However, they mainly support simple tasks for retrieving specific data items, while it is still unclear how they can be applied for interaction with large bodies of information. Given this gap, this paper focuses on chatbots for data exploration and presents a design approach whose key ingredient is a modeling technique that facilitates filtering relevant information entities and mapping data elements onto conversational elements. This enables a model-driven automatic generation of the dialog system handling conversation flows based on patterns for data exploration. Leveraging on this design framework, the paper also reports a user study that investigates whether the resulting conversational paradigm allows: i) non-technical users to explore a database content without any knowledge of specific query languages and ii) database experts to explore a database with performance and satisfaction comparable to the use of query languages.},

  abstract = {In recent years, cytological observations in the rhinological field are being increasingly utilized. This development has taken place over the last two decades and has proven to be fundamental in defining new nosological entities and in driving changes in the previous classification of rhinopathies. The simplicity of the technique and its low invasiveness make rhinocytology a practical diagnostic tool practical for all rhinoallergology services. Furthermore, since it allows the monitoring of responses to treatment, this method plays an important role in guiding a more effective and less expensive diagnostic program. Microscopic observation requires prolonged effort by a specialist, but the modern scanning systems for cytological preparations allow scanning of an entire preparation enlarged to 400x. By means of the system presented in this paper, it is possible to automatically identify and classify cells present on a rhinocytologic preparation based on a digital image of the preparation itself. Thus, pivotal diagnostic support has been made available to the rhinocytologist, who can quickly verify that the cells have been correctly classified by observation on a monitor. In the system presented herein, image processing and image segmentation techniques have been used to find images of cellular elements within the preparation. Cell classification is based on a convolutional neural network composed of three blocks of main layers. Cell identification (first step, image segmentation) exhibits accuracy greater than 90 \%, while cell classification (second step, seven cytotypes) attained a mean accuracy of approximately 98 \%. Finally, the classified cell images are shown to a specialist for rapid verification. This complete system supports clinicians in the preparation of a rhinocytogram report.},

This discrepancy is the result of limitations that are currently preventing web developers in the commercial sector from producing usable web sites. In this paper we propose a framework whose objective is to alleviate this problem by automating certain aspects of the usability evaluation process. Mainstreaming comes as a result of automation, therefore enabling a non-expert in the field of usability to conduct the evaluation. This results in reducing the costs associated with such evaluation. Additionally, the framework allows the flexibility of adding, modifying or deleting guidelines without altering the code that references them since the guidelines and the code are two separate components. A comparison of the evaluation results carried out using the framework against published evaluations of web sites carried out by web site usability professionals reveals that the framework is able to automatically identify the majority of usability violations. Due to the consistency with which it evaluates, it identified additional guideline-related violations that were not identified by the human evaluators.},

The paper is motivated by a corpus analysis of NIPS, ACL, COGSCI, and ICCV/ECCV paper titles showing differences in how work on explainable AI is positioned in various fields.

  abstract = {The complexity of creating artificial intelligence applications remains high. One of the factors that cause such complexity is the high qualification requirements for developers in the field of programming. Development complexity can be reduced by using methods and tools based on a paradigm known as End-user development. One of the problems that requires the application of the methods of this paradigm is the development of intelligent systems for supporting the search and troubleshooting onboard aircraft. Some tasks connected with this problem are identified, including the task of dynamic formation of task cards for troubleshooting in terms of forming a list of operations. This paper presents a solution to this problem based on some principles of End-user development: model-driven development, visual programming, and wizard form-filling. In particular, an extension of the Prototyping expert systems based on transformations technology, which implements the End-user development, is proposed in the context of the problem to be solved for Sukhoi Superjet aircraft. The main contribution of the work is as follows: expanded the main technology method by supporting event trees formalism (as a popular expert method for formalizing scenarios for the development of problem situations and their localization); created a domain-specific tool (namely, Extended event tree editor) for building standard and extended event trees, including for diagnostic tasks; developed a module for supporting transformations of XML-like event tree representation format for the knowledge base prototyping system -- Personal knowledge base designer. A description of the proposed extension and the means of its implementation, as well as an illustrative example, are provided.},

These explanations are often used to qualitatively assess other criteria such as safety or non-discrimination. However, despite the interest in interpretability, there is very little consensus on what interpretable machine learning is and how it should be measured. In this position paper, we first define interpretability and describe when interpretability is needed (and when it is not). Next, we suggest a taxonomy for rigorous evaluation and expose open questions towards a more rigorous science of interpretable machine learning.},

  abstract = {While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its applications to computer vision remain limited. In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is now a fairly established technology, and user experience (UX) designers appear regularly to integrate ML services in new apps, devices, and systems. Interestingly, this technology has not experienced a wealth of design innovation that other technologies have, and this might be because it is a new and difficult design material. To better understand why we have witnessed little design innovation, we conducted a survey of current UX practitioners with regards to how new ML services are envisioned and developed in UX practice. Our survey probed on how ML may or may not have been a part of their UX design education, on how they work to create new things with developers, and on the challenges they have faced working with this material. We use the findings from this survey and our review of related literature to present a series of challenges for UX and interaction design research and education. Finally, we discuss areas where new research and new curriculum might help our community unlock the power of design thinking to re-imagine what ML might be and might do.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the metaverse has attracted enormous attention from around the world with the development of related technologies. The expected metaverse should be a realistic society with more direct and physical interactions, while the concepts of race, gender, and even physical disability would be weakened, which would be highly beneficial for society. However, the development of metaverse is still in its infancy, with great potential for improvement. Regarding metaverse's huge potential, industry has already come forward with advance preparation, accompanied by feverish investment, but there are few discussions about metaverse in academia to scientifically guide its development. In this paper, we highlight the representative applications for social good. Then we propose a three-layer metaverse architecture from a macro perspective, containing infrastructure, interaction, and ecosystem. Moreover, we journey toward both a historical and novel metaverse with a detailed timeline and table of specific attributes. Lastly, we illustrate our implemented blockchain-driven metaverse prototype of a university campus and discuss the prototype design and insights.},

  abstract = {As AI-powered systems increasingly mediate consequential decision-making, their explainability is critical for end-users to take informed and accountable actions. Explanations in humanhuman interactions are socially-situated. AI systems are often socioorganizationally embedded. However, Explainable AI (XAI) approaches have been predominantly algorithm-centered. We take a developmental step towards socially-situated XAI by introducing and exploring Social Transparency (ST), a sociotechnically informed perspective that incorporates the socio-organizational context into explaining AI-mediated decision-making. To explore ST conceptually, we conducted interviews with 29 AI users and practitioners grounded in a speculative design scenario. We suggested constitutive design elements of ST and developed a conceptual framework to unpack ST's efect and implications at the technical, decisionmaking, and organizational level. The framework showcases how ST can potentially calibrate trust in AI, improve decision-making, facilitate organizational collective actions, and cultivate holistic explainability. Our work contributes to the discourse of HumanCentered XAI by expanding the design space of XAI.},

  abstract = {In an era where the ``metaverse'' is becoming real, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are undoubtedly being put under the spotlight, as highlighted by the number of companies that are trying to claim their position in this world. As part of the process of adopting these new realities, we are witnessing at a huge attempt at the digitalisation of our world: this process certainly opens new opportunities (both from a business and research perspective) but also determines new problems and challenges. As the End-User Development (EUD) aims at helping non-technical people at creating or customising their own software, we argue that non-expert users should also be able to create their own digital world also without having technical skills in IT and 3D modelling. This briefly introduces the landscape into which our work is framed: we aim at empowering non-skilled users with the ability to create their own 3D models for their digital worlds. More precisely, we design and provide a first prototype of a voice-based assistant for 3D model creation and editing. With this goal in mind, we shift the focus to the users, by involving them in the design process aiming at the design of a human-centred intelligent system. We started by executing a Wizard of Oz (WOZ) study involving people without any 3D-modelling skill. Once the study was completed, we transcribed all the recorded sessions to perform inductive thematic analysis, aiming at eliciting their mental model of the unknown task. We then performed some low-level analysis of the sentences' structure to finalise the dataset for the training of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) model. To implement the voice assistant, we used a SEQ2SEQ model for recognising users' speech, and we performed a fine-tuning of BERT to recognise the users' intents. In conclusion, this work provides new insights on the mental model of non-expert users for 3D modelling, while highlighting some requirements for the AI model that need to be fulfilled to allow a satisfying interaction. In parallel, this work also opens new doors for future exploring, especially in the choice of interaction methods for some of the tasks that are part of the 3D modelling process.},

However, users may need to create intelligent solutions tailored to their specific needs. In this way, AI systems can be enhanced if new approaches are devised to allow non-technical users to be directly involved in the definition and personalization of AI technologies. End-User Development (EUD) can provide a solution to these problems, allowing people to create, customize, or adapt AI-based systems to their own needs. This paper presents a systematic literature review that aims to shed the light on the current landscape of EUD for AI systems, i.e., how users, even without skills in AI and/or programming, can customize the AI behavior to their needs. This study also discusses the current challenges of EUD for AI, the potential benefits, and the future implications of integrating EUD into the overall AI development process.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are becoming widespread in all aspects of society, bringing benefits to the whole economy. There is a growing understanding of the potential benefits and risks of this type of technology. While the benefits are more efficient decision processes and industrial productivity, the risks may include a potential progressive disengagement of human beings in crucial aspects of decision-making. In this respect, a new perspective is emerging that aims at reconsidering the centrality of human beings while reaping the benefits of AI systems to augment rather than replace professional skills: Human-Centred AI (HCAI) is a novel framework that posits that high levels of human control do not contradict high levels of computer automation. In this paper, we investigate the two antipodes, automation vs augmentation, in the context of website usability evaluation. Specifically, we have analyzed whether the level of automation provided by a tool for semi-automatic usability evaluation can support evaluators in identifying usability problems. Three different visualizations, each one corresponding to a different level of automation, ranging from a full-automation approach to an augmentation approach, were compared in an experimental study. We found that a fully automated approach could help evaluators detect a significant number of medium and high-severity usability problems, which are the most critical in a software system; however, it also emerged that it was possible to detect more low-severity usability problems using one of the augmented approaches proposed in this paper.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTVirtual reality (VR) technology has experienced a recent surge in popularity over the past few years and is finding more applications beyond entertainment. Three dimensional modeling is an application in which integration with VR technology is still in the development stage. The focus of this research is to evaluate the feasibility for computer-aided design in VR and to identify the best set of features for virtual reality modeling and practices in this new domain. A platform for testing CAD in VR is developed through the integration of CAD software with a game engine and compared against traditional CAD methods through testing. Modeling capabilities included previews, creating solid rectangular prisms and spheres, lock to grid, and cuts of similar shapes. User testing with four different models (i.e. chair, maze, truck, sculpture) and survey responses suggest respectively that design in virtual reality promoted greater creativity in modeling, allowed for a greater feature creation rate, and that a slight majority of test participants preferred modeling in VR compared to traditional CAD applications.},

In this demo we describe ChatWoz, an application that can be used as a Wizard of Oz, to collect real data for dialogue systems, but also to allow children to interact with their caregivers through it, as it is based on a virtual agent. ChatWoz is composed of an interface controlled by the caregiver, which establishes what the agent will utter, in a synthesised voice. Several elements of the interface can be controlled, such as the agent's face emotions. In this paper we focus on the scenario of child-caregiver interaction and detail the features implemented in order to couple with it.},

The present study evaluated alternative methods for establishing age of onset for 297 individuals diagnosed with dementia through the HARMONY study. We compared two informant-based methods: a single question in a telephone screening interview and an in-depth, semi-structured, in-person interview. We then compared informant reports with medical records. The two informant-based methods yielded very similar results, r(297) = .89 (P {\textexclamdown} .0001). Informant reports were highly correlated with age of diagnosis in medical records, r(155) = .88 (P {\textexclamdown} 0.0001) for the single question, r(201) =.89 (P {\textexclamdown} .0001) for the in-depth interview. Age of diagnosis in the medical records lagged consistently 2.9 and 2.7 years behind age of onset from screening and in-depth interviews, respectively. Greater lag was associated with longer time since dementia onset, whether due to recall bias or improved detection of dementia. Lag was not influenced by dementia type, informant's relationship to proband, or proband's age. These findings suggest that informant reports of age of dementia onset are reliable and reasonably valid, even when only a single question is asked within the context of a larger interview.},

However, we lack knowledge on how to classify chatbots and how such classification can be brought to bear in analysis of chatbot interaction design. In this workshop paper, we propose a typology of chatbots to support such classification and analysis. The typology dimensions address key characteristics that differentiate current chatbots: the duration of the user's relation with the chatbot (short-term and long-term), and the locus of control for user's interaction with the chatbot (user-driven and chatbot-driven). To explore the usefulness of the typology, we present four example chatbot purposes for which the typology may support analysis of high-level chatbot interaction design. Furthermore, we analyse a sample of 57 chatbots according to the typology dimensions. The relevance and application of the typology for developers and service providers are discussed.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining more and more attention both in the academic and in the industrial worlds. IoT is a concept describing a vision in which everyday objects will be connected to the Internet, will be identified, and will, possibly, communicate with other devices. These objects are typically referred as ``smart objects'', which can be defined as real artifacts augmented with computing, communication, sensing/actuation and storing functionalities. Their importance resides in the capabilities they have to make physical environments ``smart'' so as to provide novel cyberphysical services to people. In the last years, several middlewares for SOs were proposed. Middlewares, widely used in conventional distributed systems, are fundamental tools for the design and implementation of smart objects as well as of smart environment applications. They provide general and specific abstractions (e.g. object computation model, inter-object communication, sensory/actuation interfaces, discovery service, knowledge management) through which smart objects and their related applications can be easily built up. In this chapter, we present an overview of middlewares for smart objects and smart environments and compare them according to the most important general and specific requirements that have been identified in the literature so far. Moreover, such middlewares are also compared according to a feature-oriented framework to better highlight their distinctive properties. The comparison therefore provides a clear picture about the suitability of such middlewares to support the development of SO-based IoT systems. Finally, the chapter will briefly discuss on-going challenges in this research area.},

Great effort is put into the development of methods to detect machine generations among human-written text in order to avoid scenarios in which the large-scale generation of text with minimal cost and effort undermines the trust in human interaction and factual information online. While most of the current approaches rely on the availability of expensive language models, we propose a simple feature-based classifier for the detection problem, using carefully crafted features that attempt to model intrinsic differences between human and machine text. Our research contributes to the field in producing a detection method that achieves performance competitive with far more expensive methods, offering an accessible ``first line-ofdefense'' against the abuse of language models. Furthermore, our experiments show that different sampling methods lead to different types of flaws in generated text.},

In this study, physicians received chest X-rays and diagnostic advice, some of which was inaccurate, and were asked to evaluate advice quality and make diagnoses. All advice was generated by human experts, but some was labeled as coming from an AI system. As a group, radiologists rated advice as lower quality when it appeared to come from an AI system; physicians with less task-expertise did not. Diagnostic accuracy was significantly worse when participants received inaccurate advice, regardless of the purported source. This work raises important considerations for how advice, AI and non-AI, should be deployed in clinical environments.},

Diagnosis of inflammatory diseases is a major aspect of Rhinology, both due to the incidence of these diseases and the problems encountered when seeking precise diagnoses, etiologies and pathogeneses in order to provide optimal therapies. Nasal cytology is still a little-used diagnostic technique, yet it has proved crucial in the diagnosis of a number of nasal diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, NARES (non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome), NARNE (non-allergic rhinitis with neutrophils), NARMA (non-allergic rhinitis with mast cells) and NARESMA (non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophils and mast cells). This atlas was prepared in order to meet several needs. It provides an explanation for specific aspects of nasal cytology along with a theoretical approach to the topic, while including many illustrations showing specific cell morphology features of different nasal diseases. In addition to the wealth of intricately detailed color illustrations showing the cytological features of each type of disease considered, it also provides clear and comprehensive descriptions of swab taking and other technical procedures. All the while, it makes ongoing references to the etiologies and pathogeneses of the various disease processes involved.},

  abstract = {Our life is characterized by the presence of a multitude of interactive devices and smart objects exploited for disparate goals in different contexts of use. Thus, it is impossible for application developers to predict at design time the devices and objects users will exploit, how they will be arranged, and in which situations and for which objectives they will be used. For such reasons, it is important to make end users able to easily and autonomously personalize the behaviour of their Internet of Things applications, so that they can better comply with their specific expectations. In this paper, we present a method and a set of tools that allow end users without programming experience to customize the context-dependent behaviour of their Web applications through the specification of trigger-action rules. The environment is able to support end-user specification of more flexible behaviour than what can be done with existing commercial tools, and it also includes an underlying infrastructure able to detect the possible contextual changes in order to achieve the desired behaviour. The resulting set of tools is able to support the dynamic creation and execution of personalized application versions more suitable for users' needs in specific contexts of use. Thus, it represents a contribution to obtaining low threshold/high ceiling environments. We also report on an example application in the home automation domain, and a user study that has provided useful positive feedback.},

It causes significant mortality and morbidity, which can be reduced by early diagnosis with an effective screening test. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and computer-aided detection (CAD) with screening methods has shown promising colorectal cancer screening results. AI could provide a ``second look'' for endoscopists to decrease the rate of missed polyps during a colonoscopy. It can also improve detection and characterization of polyps by integration with colonoscopy and various advanced endoscopic modalities such as magnifying narrow-band imaging, endocytoscopy, confocal endomicroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy, and magnifying chromoendoscopy. This descriptive review discusses various AI and CAD applications in colorectal cancer screening, polyp detection, and characterization.},

  abstract = {One of the greatest cyber threats of our time is phishing, a cybercrime in which criminals try to steal personal information from victims with different techniques, e.g., by using malicious emails. Warning messages are a useful tool in combating phishing attacks, but they often lack information about why a specific email is considered dangerous. In this thesis, we present the design and development of an eXplainble Artificial Intelligence tool for phishing detection that classifies emails as phishing/non-phishing, also showing users explanations about the causes that led to the classification of a specific mail as suspicious. To be interpretable to lay users, a selection of features that the ML model uses for the classification has been performed to explain only features that do not require IT knowledge. Different state-of-the-art ML and AI models have been trained and tested on publicly available datasets of phishing emails. While interpretable models (such as decision tree and logistic regression classifiers) are explainable by-design, to explain black-box models we have employed the most common post-hoc explanation mechanisms.},

AI solutions are already being used to detect phishing emails, but they typically do not address the problem of explaining to users why certain emails are considered dangerous. This leads to users not understanding the risk and/or not trusting the defense system, resulting in higher success rates of phishing attacks. This paper presents an XAI-based solution to classify phishing emails and alert users to the risk by explaining the reasons behind the attacks. We compared different ML models using a subset of features that can be explained and understood by non-IT users. We found that Explainable Boosting Machine was the best choice for a high-performance and interpretable classifier for email phishing detection.},

This is also the case with phishing emails: when a defense system detects a suspicious message, users are typically presented with warning dialogs that inform them of the risks. However, warnings are often designed without adequate consideration of the end user, leading to incorrect decisions that lower the benefit of the AI models. To overcome the limitations identified in the literature, this paper presents an XAI phishing detection system built following a human-centered design approach. It classifies phishing emails and generates polymorphic warning dialogs that explain to the user why the email might be a scam, with the ultimate goal of supporting a more informed decision on whether or not to open suspicious content.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) offer numerous benefits, but they also pose threats, such as cybercriminals creating fake, convincing content such as phishing emails. LLMs are more convenient for criminals than handcrafting, making phishing campaigns more likely and more widespread in the future. To combat these attacks, detecting whether an email is generated by LLMs is critical. However, previous attempts have resulted in solutions that are uninterpretable and resource-intensive due to their complexity. This results in warning dialogs that do not adequately protect users. This work aims to address this problem using traditional, lightweight machine learning models that are easy to interpret and require fewer computational resources. This approach allows users to understand why an email is AI-generated, improving their decision-making in the case of phishing emails. This study has shown that logistic regression can achieve excellent performance in detecting emails generated by LLMs, while still providing the transparency needed to provide useful explanations to users.},

However, these human abilities can benefit from rapidly growing computational capabilities. We can apply computational power to support and augment cognitive skills that will bolster the limited human cognitive resource and provide new capabilities through this symbiosis. We now have the ability to design human-computer interaction capabilities where the computer anticipates, predicts, and augments the performance of the user and where the human supports, aids, and enhances the learning and performance of the computer. Augmented cognition seeks to advance this human-machine symbiosis through both machine understanding of the human (such as physical state sensing, cognitive state sensing, psychophysiology, emotion detection, and intent projection) and human understanding of the machine (such as explainable AI, shared situation awareness, trust enhancement, and advanced UX). The ultimate result being a truly interactive symbiosis where humans and computers are tightly coupled in productive partnerships that merge the best of the human with the best of the machine. As advances in artificial intelligence (AI) accelerate across a myriad of applications, we seek to understand the current state-of-the-art of AI and how it may be best applied for advancing human-machine symbiosis.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence is increasingly becoming integrated in many aspects of human life. One particular AI comes in the form of conversational agents (CAs) such as Siri, Alexa, and chatbots used for customer service on websites and other information systems. It is widely accepted that humans treat systems as social actors. Leveraging this bias, companies sometimes attempt to masquerade a CA as a human customer service representative. In addition to the ethical and legal questions around this practice, the benefits and drawbacks of a CA pretending to be human are unclear due to a lack of study. While more human-like interactions can improve outcomes, when users find out that the CA is not human, they may have a negative reaction that may cause reputation harm in the company. In this research we use Expectation Violation Theory to explain what happens when users have high or low expectations of a conversation. We conducted an experiment with 175 participants where some participants were told they were interacting with a CA while others were told they were interacting with a human. We further divided the groups so that some participants interacted with a CA with low conversational capability while others interacted with a CA with high conversational capability. The results show that expectations formed by the user before the interaction change how the user evaluates the CA beyond the actual performance of the CA. These findings provide guidance to developers not just of conversational agents, but also for other technologies where users may be uncertain of a system's capabilities.},

  abstract = {Whole brain segmentation from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a prerequisite for most morphological analyses, but is computationally intense and can therefore delay the availability of image markers after scan acquisition. We introduce QuickNAT, a fully convolutional, densely connected neural network that segments a MRI brain scan in 20 s. To enable training of the complex network with millions of learnable parameters using limited annotated data, we propose to first pre-train on auxiliary labels created from existing segmentation software. Subsequently, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned on manual labels to rectify errors in auxiliary labels. With this learning strategy, we are able to use large neuroimaging repositories without manual annotations for training. In an extensive set of evaluations on eight datasets that cover a wide age range, pathology, and different scanners, we demonstrate that QuickNAT achieves superior segmentation accuracy and reliability in comparison to state-of-the-art methods, while being orders of magnitude faster. The speed up facilitates processing of large data repositories and supports translation of imaging biomarkers by making them available within seconds for fast clinical decision making.},

The applications in which black box decision systems can be used are various, and each approach is typically developed to provide a solution for a specific problem and, as a consequence, it explicitly or implicitly delineates its own definition of interpretability and explanation. The aim of this article is to provide a classification of the main problems addressed in the literature with respect to the notion of explanation and the type of black box system. Given a problem definition, a black box type, and a desired explanation, this survey should help the researcher to find the proposals more useful for his own work. The proposed classification of approaches to open black box models should also be useful for putting the many research open questions in perspective.},

  abstract = {The last decade has witnessed the rise of a black box society where obscure classification models are adopted by Artificial Intelligence systems (AI). The lack of explanations of how AI systems make decisions is a key ethical issue to their adoption in socially sensitive and safety-critical contexts. Indeed, the problem is not only for lack of transparency but also for possible biases inherited by the AI from prejudices hidden in the training data. Thus, the research in eXplainable AI (XAI) has recently caught much attention. The applications in which AI systems are employed are various. Therefore, there are many requirements for different types of explanations for different users. We survey the existing proposals in the literature by discussing which are the principles of XAI. In addition, we illustrate different types of explanations returned by established explainers. Finally, we discuss their usability and how they can be exploited in real-world applications.},

  abstract = {New technologies, data, and algorithms impact nearly every aspect of daily life. Unfortunately, many of these algorithms operate like black boxes and cannot explain their results even to their programmers, let alone to end-users. As more and more tasks get delegated to such intelligent systems and the nature of user interactions with them becomes increasingly complex, it is important to understand the amount of trust that a user is willing to place on such systems. However, attempts at quantifying trust have either been limited in their scope or not empirically thorough. To address this, we build on prior work which empirically modelled trust in usertechnology interactions and describe the development and evolution of a human computer trust scale. We present results of two studies (N=118 \& N=183) which were undertaken to assess the reliability and validity of the proposed scale. Our study contributes to the literature by (a) developing a multi-dimensional scale to assess user trust in HCI and (b) being the first study to use the concept of design fiction and future scenarios to study trust.},

However, distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated text has become a significant task. This article presents a comparative study, introducing a novel dataset of human-written and LLM-generated texts in different genres: essays, stories, poetry and Python code. We employ several machine learning models to classify the texts. Results demonstrate the efficacy of these models in discerning between human and AI-generated text, despite the dataset's limited sample size. However, the task becomes more challenging when classifying GPT-generated text, particularly in story writing. The results indicate that the models exhibit superior performance in binary classification tasks, such as distinguishing human-generated text from a specific LLM, compared with the more complex multiclass tasks that involve discerning among human-generated and multiple LLMs. Our findings provide insightful implications for AI text detection, while our dataset paves the way for future research in this evolving area.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8{\texttimes} deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

  abstract = {Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular as a human-computer interface. The traditional best practices normally applied to User Experience (UX) design cannot easily be applied to chatbots, nor can conventional usability testing techniques guarantee accuracy. WeightMentor is a bespoke self-help motivational tool for weight loss maintenance. This study addresses the following four research questions: How usable is the WeightMentor chatbot, according to conventional usability methods?; To what extend will different conventional usability questionnaires correlate when evaluating chatbot usability?; And how do they correlate to a tailored chatbot usability survey score?; What is the optimum number of users required to identify chatbot usability issues?; How many task repetitions are required for a first-time chatbot users to reach optimum task performance (i.e. efficiency based on task completion times)? This paper describes the procedure for testing the WeightMentor chatbot, assesses correlation between typical usability testing metrics, and suggests that conventional wisdom on participant numbers for identifying usability issues may not apply to chatbots. The study design was a usability study. WeightMentor was tested using a pre-determined usability testing protocol, evaluating ease of task completion, unique usability errors and participant opinions on the chatbot (collected using usability questionnaires). WeightMentor usability scores were generally high, and correlation between questionnaires was strong. The optimum number of users for identifying chatbot usability errors was 26, which challenges previous research. Chatbot users reached optimum proficiency in tasks after just one repetition. Usability test outcomes confirm what is already known about chatbots - that they are highly usable (due to their simple interface and conversation-driven functionality) but conventional methods for assessing usability and user experience may not be as accurate when applied to chatbots.},

Study objectives: 1) to test the construct validity of CUQ (i.e. does it differentiate between chatbots that we rank as having poor, average or good usability), 2) to assess the intra-rater reliability of CUQ (i.e. do participants provide the same answers/scores when assessing the usability of the same chatbots two weeks apart), and 3) to undertake exploratory factor analysis to study the underlying factors that CUQ measures. Three chatbots were selected by co-authors that were regarded as having good, average and poor usability. Participants used each of the chatbots and completed the CUQ scale for each. Participants repeated this process two weeks later to facilitate the measurement intra-rater variability. Paired t-tests were used to compare CUQ scores from each of the three chatbots. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the factors within the CUQ. Paired t-tests and correlation was used to measure intra-rater reliability. There was a total of 156 CUQ survey completions (26 participants completed the CUQ for 3 different chatbots and for 2 rounds: 26 * 3 * 2=156). Intra-rater reliability was supported as there was a good correlation between how participants completed the CUQ for the same chatbot at approximately two weeks apart (r{\textquestiondown}0.7). As a form of construct validity, the CUQ scores for each of the three chatbots were statistically significant (p{\textexclamdown}0.05). Factor analysis shows that the CUQ measures four factors 1) personality, 2) user experience, 3) error handling and 4) onboarding of the chatbot.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) generally and machine learning (ML) specifically demonstrate impressive practical success in many different application domains, e.g. in autonomous driving, speech recognition, or recommender systems. Deep learning approaches, trained on extremely large data sets or using reinforcement learning methods have even exceeded human performance in visual tasks, particularly on playing games such as Atari, or mastering the game of Go. Even in the medical domain there are remarkable results. The central problem of such models is that they are regarded as black-box models and even if we understand the underlying mathematical principles, they lack an explicit declarative knowledge representation, hence have difficulty in generating the underlying explanatory structures. This calls for systems enabling to make decisions transparent, understandable and explainable. A huge motivation for our approach are rising legal and privacy aspects. The new European General Data Protection Regulation entering into force on May 25th 2018, will make black-box approaches difficult to use in business. This does not imply a ban on automatic learning approaches or an obligation to explain everything all the time, however, there must be a possibility to make the results re-traceable on demand. In this paper we outline some of our research topics in the context of the relatively new area of explainable-AI with a focus on the application in medicine, which is a very special domain. This is due to the fact that medical professionals are working mostly with distributed heterogeneous and complex sources of data. In this paper we concentrate on three sources: images, *omics data and text. We argue that research in explainable-AI would generally help to facilitate the implementation of AI/ML in the medical domain, and specifically help to facilitate transparency and trust.},

  abstract = {Personas have successfully supported the development of classical user interfaces for more than two decades by mapping users' mental models to specific contexts. The rapid proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications makes it necessary to create new approaches for future human-AI interfaces. Human-AI interfaces differ from classical human-computer interfaces in many ways, such as gaining some degree of human-like cognitive, self-executing, and self-adaptive capabilities and autonomy, and generating unexpected outputs that require non-deterministic interactions. Moreover, the most successful AI approaches are so-called ``black box'' systems, where the technology and the machine learning process are opaque to the user and the AI output is far not intuitive. This work shows how the personas method can be adapted to support the development of human-centered AI applications, and we demonstrate this on the example of a medical context. This work is - to our knowledge - the first to provide personas for AI using an openly available Personas for AI toolbox. The toolbox contains guidelines and material supporting persona development for AI as well as templates and pictures for persona visualisation. It is ready to use and freely available to the international research and development community. Additionally, an example from medical AI is provided as a best practice use case. This work is intended to help foster the development of novel human-AI interfaces that will be urgently needed in the near future.},

Nevertheless, we extract from the literature distinct and highly developed concepts, for instance viewing interaction as dialogue, transmission, optimal behavior, embodiment, and tool use. Importantly, these concepts are associated with different scopes and ways of construing the causal relationships between the human and the computer. This affects their ability to inform empirical studies and design. Based on this discussion, we list desiderata for future work on interaction, emphasizing the need to improve scope and specificity, to better account for the effects and agency that computers have in interaction, and to generate strong propositions about interaction.},

For instance, to achieve the frequently used commands, such as rotating and zoom in/zoom out, users have to memorize the multiple hotkey (keyboard + mice) or use the graphic icon to perform these actions. Moreover, it would be even more inconvenient if you cross different 3D modeling softwares (Maya and 3D studio Max). The rotation function hotkeys are totally different even if there are designed in the same company (Autodesk). To increase the efficiency of 3D modeling, the CAD users usually need to memorize complicated hotkey combinations for different softwares. Hence, the challenge of this research is to generate a universal, intuitive and natural way to perform the ``rotate'' and ``zoom in/out'' command in 3D CAD modeling. Also, this alternative ``rotate'' and ``zoom in/out'' input can be widely applied to other 3D CAD softwares. We create a ``BCI embedded CAD'' prototype that connects EPOC+ to maxscript (3D studio Max). Through the system, the user is able to enhance the ability in 3D modeling through ``thinking the commends''. In the future study, the BCI embedded CAD can be modified as a cross-platform 3D CAD manipulation that enables users to use imagination to control 3D modeling in different softwares (Maya, 3D studio Max, and Rihno) rather than traditional text-based commands or graphical icons.},

  abstract = {Intent recognition models, which match a written or spoken input's class in order to guide an interaction, are an essential part of modern voice user interfaces, chatbots, and social robots. However, getting enough data to train these models can be very expensive and challenging, especially when designing novel applications such as real-world human-robot interactions. In this work, we first investigate how much training data is needed for high performance in an intent classification task. We train and evaluate BiLSTM and BERT models on various subsets of the ATIS and Snips datasets. We find that only 25 training examples per intent are required for our BERT model to achieve 94\% intent accuracy compared to 98\% with the entire datasets, challenging the belief that large amounts of labeled data are required for high performance in intent recognition. We apply this knowledge to train models for a real-world HRI application, character strength recognition during a positive psychology interaction with a social robot, and evaluate against the Character Strength dataset collected in our previous HRI study. Our real-world HRI application results also confirm that our model can produce 76\% intent accuracy with 25 examples per intent compared to 80\% with 100 examples. In a real-world scenario, the difference is only one additional error per 25 classifications. Finally, we investigate the limitations of our minimal data models and offer suggestions on developing high quality datasets. We conclude with practical guidelines for training BERT intent recognition models with minimal training data and make our code and evaluation framework available for others to replicate our results and easily develop models for their own applications.},

  abstract = {Detailed whole brain segmentation is an essential quantitative technique in medical image analysis, which provides a non-invasive way of measuring brain regions from a clinical acquired structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recently, deep convolution neural network (CNN) has been applied to whole brain segmentation. However, restricted by current GPU memory, 2D based methods, downsampling based 3D CNN methods, and patch-based high-resolution 3D CNN methods have been the de facto standard solutions. 3D patch-based high resolution methods typically yield superior performance among CNN approaches on detailed whole brain segmentation ({\textquestiondown}100 labels), however, whose performance are still commonly inferior compared with state-of-the-art multi-atlas segmentation methods (MAS) due to the following challenges: (1) a single network is typically used to learn both spatial and contextual information for the patches, (2) limited manually traced whole brain volumes are available (typically less than 50) for training a network. In this work, we propose the spatially localized atlas network tiles (SLANT) method to distribute multiple independent 3D fully convolutional networks (FCN) for high-resolution whole brain segmentation. To address the first challenge, multiple spatially distributed networks were used in the SLANT method, in which each network learned contextual information for a fixed spatial location. To address the second challenge, auxiliary labels on 5111 initially unlabeled scans were created by multi-atlas segmentation for training. Since the method integrated multiple traditional medical image processing methods with deep learning, we developed a containerized pipeline to deploy the end-to-end solution. From the results, the proposed method achieved superior performance compared with multi-atlas segmentation methods, while reducing the computational time from {\textquestiondown}30 h to 15 min. The method has been made available in open source (https://github.com/MASILab/SLANTbrainSeg).},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have recently been radically improved and are now being employed in almost every application domain to develop automated or semi-automated systems. To facilitate greater human acceptability of these systems, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has experienced significant growth over the last couple of years with the development of highly accurate models but with a paucity of explainability and interpretability. The literature shows evidence from numerous studies on the philosophy and methodologies of XAI. Nonetheless, there is an evident scarcity of secondary studies in connection with the application domains and tasks, let alone review studies following prescribed guidelines, that can enable researchers' understanding of the current trends in XAI, which could lead to future research for domain- and application-specific method development. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on the recent developments of XAI methods and evaluation metrics concerning different application domains and tasks. This study considers 137 articles published in recent years and identified through the prominent bibliographic databases. This systematic synthesis of research articles resulted in several analytical findings: XAI methods are mostly developed for safety-critical domains worldwide, deep learning and ensemble models are being exploited more than other types of AI/ML models, visual explanations are more acceptable to end-users and robust evaluation metrics are being developed to assess the quality of explanations. Research studies have been performed on the addition of explanations to widely used AI/ML models for expert users. However, more attention is required to generate explanations for general users from sensitive domains such as finance and the judicial system.},

It is intended to be used by those managing design processes, and is concerned with ways in which both hardware and software components of interactive systems can enhance human?system interaction. NOTE Computer-based interactive systems vary in scale and complexity. Examples include off-the-shelf (shrink-wrap) software products, custom office systems, process control systems, automated banking systems, Web sites and applications, and consumer products such as vending machines, mobile phones and digital television. Throughout this document, such systems are generally referred to as products, systems or services although, for simplicity, sometimes only one term is used. This document provides an overview of human-centred design activities. It does not provide detailed coverage of the methods and techniques required for human-centred design, nor does it address health or safety aspects in detail. Although it addresses the planning and management of human-centred design, it does not address all aspects of project management. The information in this document is intended for use by those responsible for planning and managing projects that design and develop interactive systems. It therefore addresses technical human factors and ergonomics issues only to the extent necessary to allow such individuals to understand their relevance and importance in the design process as a whole. It also provides a framework for human factors and usability professionals involved in human-centred design. Detailed human factors/ergonomics, usability and accessibility issues are dealt with more fully in a number of standards including other parts of ISO 9241 (see Annex A) and ISO 6385, which sets out the broad principles of ergonomics. The requirements and recommendations in this document can benefit all parties involved in human-centred design and development. Annex B provides a checklist that can be used to support claims of conformance with this document.},

  n2 = {Current psychological theory and research affirm the positive affective and motivational consequences of having personal choice. These findings have led to the popular notion that the more choice, the better---that the human ability to manage, and the human desire for, choice is unlimited. Findings from 3 experimental studies starkly challenge this implicit assumption that having more choices is necessarily more intrinsically motivating than having fewer. These experiments, which were conducted in both field and laboratory settings, show that people are more likely to purchase gourmet jams or chocolates or to undertake optional class essay assignments when offered a limited array of 6 choices rather than a more extensive array of 24 or 30 choices. Moreover, participants actually reported greater subsequent satisfaction with their selections and wrote better essays when their original set of options had been limited. Implications for future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

This versatility to solve diverse problems is achieved by transforming complex Spatio-temporal datasets to make them consumable by standard deep learning models, in this case, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and giving the ability to formulate disparate problems in a standard way, eg. semantic segmentation. With an intuitive user interface, a feature store that hosts derivatives of complex feature engineering, a deep learning kernel, and a scalable data processing mechanism, Trinity provides a powerful platform for domain experts to share the stage with scientists and engineers in solving business-critical problems. It enables quick prototyping, rapid experimentation and reduces the time to production by standardizing model building and deployment. In this paper, we present our motivation behind Trinity and its design along with showcasing sample applications to motivate the idea of lowering the bar to using AI.},

  abstract = {Trust is a central component of the interaction between people and AI, in that 'incorrect' levels of trust may cause misuse, abuse or disuse of the technology. But what, precisely, is the nature of trust in AI? What are the prerequisites and goals of the cognitive mechanism of trust, and how can we promote them, or assess whether they are being satisfied in a given interaction? This work aims to answer these questions. We discuss a model of trust inspired by, but not identical to, interpersonal trust (i.e., trust between people) as defined by sociologists. This model rests on two key properties: the vulnerability of the user; and the ability to anticipate the impact of the AI model's decisions. We incorporate a formalization of 'contractual trust', such that trust between a user and an AI model is trust that some implicit or explicit contract will hold, and a formalization of 'trustworthiness' (that detaches from the notion of trustworthiness in sociology), and with it concepts of 'warranted' and 'unwarranted' trust. We present the possible causes of warranted trust as intrinsic reasoning and extrinsic behavior, and discuss how to design trustworthy AI, how to evaluate whether trust has manifested, and whether it is warranted. Finally, we elucidate the connection between trust and XAI using our formalization.},

However, chatbots are still in their nascent stage: They have a low penetration rate as 84 \% of the Internet users have not used a chatbot yet. Hence, understanding the usage patterns of first-time users can potentially inform and guide the design of future chatbots. In this paper, we report the findings of a study with 16 first-time chatbot users interacting with eight chatbots over multiple sessions on the Facebook Messenger platform. Analysis of chat logs and user interviews revealed that users preferred chatbots that provided either a 'human-like' natural language conversation ability, or an engaging experience that exploited the benefits of the familiar turn-based messaging interface. We conclude with implications to evolve the design of chatbots, such as: clarify chatbot capabilities, sustain conversation context, handle dialog failures, and end conversations gracefully.},

  abstract = {Artificial speech developed using speech synthesizers has been used as the voice for robots in Human Robot Interaction (HRI). As humans anthropomorphize robots, an empathetically interacting robot is expected to increase the level of acceptance of social robots. Here, a human perception experiment evaluates whether human subjects perceive empathy in robot speech. For this experiment, empathy is expressed only by adding appropriate emotions to the words in speech. Also, humans' preferences for a robot interacting with empathetic speech versus a standard robotic voice are also assessed. The results show that humans are able to perceive empathy and emotions in robot speech, and prefer it over the standard robotic voice. It is important for the emotions in empathetic speech to be consistent with the language content of what is being said, and with the human users' emotional state. Analyzing emotions in empathetic speech using valence-arousal model has revealed the importance of secondary emotions in developing empathetically speaking social robots.},

  abstract = {Consumers' dramatic demand has a pernicious effect throughout the supply chain. It exacerbates inventory distortion because of significant revenue loss caused by stock-level issues. Despite the availability of several forecasting techniques, large organisations, manufacturing firms, and e-commerce websites collectively lose around \$1.8 trillion annually to inventory distortion. If this problem is solved, sales may increase by 10.3 percent. The businesses are concerned about mitigating this loss. Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a significant role in building resilient supply chains. However, developing AI models consumes time and cost. In this paper, we propose a No Code Artificial Intelligence (NCAI) enabling non-technical companies to build machine learning models based on production quantity and inventory replenishment. The development of the NCAI model is fast and inexpensive. However, little research deals with applying NCAI to operations and supply chain problems. Addressing the existing gap, we show the application of NCAI in the retail industry.},

In order to understand the relationship between trust in computerized systems and the use of those systems, we need to be able to effectively measure trust. Although questionnaires regarding trust have been used in prior studies, these questionnaires were theoretically rather than empirically generated and did not distinguish between three potentially different types of trust: human--human trust, human--machine trust, and trust in general. A 3-phased experiment, comprising a word elicitation study, a questionnaire study, and a paired comparison study, was performed to better understand similarities and differences in the concepts of trust and distrust, and among the different types of trust. Results indicated that trust and distrust can be considered opposites, rather than different concepts. Components of trust, in terms of words related to trust, were similar across the three types of trust. Results obtained from a cluster analysis were used to identify 12 potential factors of trust between people and automated systems. These 12 factors were then used to develop a proposed scale to measure trust in automation.},

  abstract = {Tracking down usability problems poses a challenge for developers since users rarely report explicit feedback without being asked for it. Hence, implicit feedback represents a valuable information source, in particular for rapid development processes with frequent software releases. Users' emotions expressed by their facial expressions during interactions with the application can act as the source of such information. Recent development in consumer hardware offers mechanisms to efficiently detect facial expressions. We developed a framework for interactive mobile applications to harness consumer hardware camera technology for facial feature extraction to enable emotion detection following the facial action coding system. In a study with 12 participants, we evaluated its performance within a sample application that was seeded with usability problems. A qualitative analysis of the study results indicates that the framework is applicable for detecting user emotions from facial expressions. A quantitative analysis shows that emotional responses can be detected in three out of four cases and that they relate to usability problems. We conclude that, in combination with interaction events, the framework can support developers in the exploration of usability problems in interactive applications.},

  abstract = {Companies across domains are rapidly engaged in shifting computational power and intelligence from centralized cloud to fully decentralized edges to maximize value delivery, strengthen security and reduce latency. However, most companies have only recently started pursuing this opportunity and are therefore at the early stage of the cloud-to-edge transition. To provide an overview of AI deployment in the context of edge/cloud/hybrid architectures, we conduct a systematic literature review and a grey literature review. To advance understanding of how to integrate, deploy, operationalize and evolve AI models, we derive a framework from existing literature to accelerate the end-to-end deployment process. The framework is organized into five phases: Design, Integration, Deployment, Operation and Evolution. We make an attempt to analyze the extracted results by comparing and contrasting them to derive insights. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, we conduct a systematic literature review in which we review the contemporary scientific literature and provide a detailed overview of the state-of-the-art of AI deployment. Second, we review the grey literature and present the state-of-practice and experience of practitioners while deploying AI models. Third, we present a framework derived from existing literature for the end-to-end deployment process and attempt to compare and contrast SLR and GLR results.},

This paper explores the potential of eye tracking as a CAD interface, and presents a prototype that uses collected gaze data to support shape exploration in a two-dimensional vector-based sketch editor. The eye tracking interface uses the visual interactions of users to identify interpretations of constructed shapes, according to recognised parts identified using methods from shape grammar research. It can therefore be argued that it supports construction and manipulation of shapes according to user intent. The prototype has been evaluated in a user study where design students carried out controlled shape exploration exercises which involved interpretation and manipulation of shapes. In the paper, key concepts of eye tracking methodology are introduced; the methods used to implement the eye tracking interface are described; and the user study and its outcomes are reported. The results are positive and indicate the potential for eye tracking as an interface for supporting shape exploration in CAD.},

  abstract = {A proposal for a unified theory of learned trust implemented in a cognitive architecture is presented. The theory is instantiated as a computational cognitive model of learned trust that integrates several seemingly unrelated categories of findings from the literature on interpersonal and human-machine interactions and makes unintuitive predictions for future studies. The model relies on a combination of learning mechanisms to explain a variety of phenomena such as trust asymmetry, the higher impact of early trust breaches, the black-hat/white-hat effect, the correlation between trust and cognitive ability, and the higher resilience of interpersonal as compared to human-machine trust. In addition, the model predicts that trust decays in the absence of evidence of trustworthiness or untrustworthiness. The implications of the model for the advancement of the theory on trust are discussed. Specifically, this work suggests two more trust antecedents on the trustor's side: perceived trust necessity and cognitive ability to detect cues of trustworthiness.},

For example, an automated Learning Companion or Intelligent Tutoring System might use this information to intervene, providing support to the learner who is likely to otherwise quit, while leaving engaged learners free to discover things without interruption. This paper presents the first automated method that assesses, using multiple channels of affect-related information, whether a learner is about to click on a button saying ``I'm frustrated.'' The new method was tested on data gathered from 24 participants using an automated Learning Companion. Their indication of frustration was automatically predicted from the collected data with 79\% accuracy (chance=58\%). The new assessment method is based on Gaussian process classification and Bayesian inference. Its performance suggests that non-verbal channels carrying affective cues can help provide important information to a system for formulating a more intelligent response.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic decision making are having a profound impact on our daily lives. These systems are vastly used in different high-stakes applications like healthcare, business, government, education, and justice, moving us toward a more algorithmic society. However, despite so many advantages of these systems, they sometimes directly or indirectly cause harm to the users and society. Therefore, it has become essential to make these systems safe, reliable, and trustworthy. Several requirements, such as fairness, explainability, accountability, reliability, and acceptance, have been proposed in this direction to make these systems trustworthy. This survey analyzes all of these different requirements through the lens of the literature. It provides an overview of different approaches that can help mitigate AI risks and increase trust and acceptance of the systems by utilizing the users and society. It also discusses existing strategies for validating and verifying these systems and the current standardization efforts for trustworthy AI. Finally, we present a holistic view of the recent advancements in trustworthy AI to help the interested researchers grasp the crucial facets of the topic efficiently and offer possible future research directions.},

Twenty-six users (13 programmers and 13 frequent computer users) took part in the study. A background software application executing on participants' computers logged the keyboard key press and mouse click events. The correlations between moods of the participants and their use of keyboard and mouse show that it might be possible to create individual tailor made mood measures based on individuals keyboard and mouse use. The highest and lowest significant correlations found were r (63) = 0.39, p{\textexclamdown}= 0.01 and r (73) = -0.24, p{\textexclamdown}= 0.05 respectively. About 31\% of participants showed significant correlations towards valence whereas about 27\% showed significant correlations toward arousal. Further, the data shows that experience and self discipline might be a factor to predict people who show significant correlation between their behaviour and valence level. Similarly dutifulness might help in predicting people who show significant correlation between their behaviour and arousal level.},

In this paper, we examine the 3D modeling procedures articulated by the participants, using gestures and speech, for creating basic 3D models of increasing complexity. We identified 3D modeling procedures and characterized them as CAD legacy and non-legacy procedures. Results show that (1) non-legacy procedures were employed by a considerable number of participants who had fair and high proficiency in CAD and (2) Non-legacy procedures with fewer steps were rated favorably by participants. Based on the results, we provide recommendations on key aspects of non-legacy procedures that need to be incorporated in CAD modeling programs to facilitate speech and gestural input.},

  abstract = {Multimodal interaction techniques using gesture and speech offer architects and engineers a natural way to create 3D CAD (computer-aided design) models for conceptual design. Gestures and speech for such interfaces must be based on empirically grounded knowledge instead of arbitrary vocabularies as employed in extant literature. We conducted an experiment with 41 participants from architecture and engineering backgrounds to elicit preferences of gestures and speech for 3D CAD modeling referents such as primitives, manipulations, and navigation. In this paper, we present results from the thematic analysis of the elicited gestures. We present a compilation of gestures, which were evaluated by experts to be suitable for the articulation of 3D CAD modeling referents. We also present a set of speech command terms elicited from participants. Finally, we provide recommendations for the design of a gesture and speech based CAD modeling system for conceptual design.},

A systematic review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guideline presented in this report was derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers. The guideline has been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research. The guideline covers three phases of a systematic review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. It is at a relatively high level. It does not consider the impact of question type on the review procedures, nor does it specify in detail mechanisms needed to undertake meta-analysis.},

During the last decade, several studies have discussed pros and cons of lab and field evaluations. Based on these discussions, we conduct a review to explore the past decade of mobile HCI research on field and lab evaluation, investigating responses in the literature to the "is it worth the hassle?" paper from 2004. We find that while our knowledge and experience with both lab and field studies have grown considerably, there is still no definite answer to the lab versus field question. In response we suggest that the real question is not if -- but when and how -- to go into the field. In response we suggest moving beyond usability evaluations, and to engage with field studies that are truly in-the-wild, and longitudinal.},

  abstract = {Autonomous agents capable of planning, reasoning, and executing actions on the web offer a promising avenue for automating computer tasks. However, the majority of existing benchmarks primarily focus on text-based agents, neglecting many natural tasks that require visual information to effectively solve. Given that most computer interfaces cater to human perception, visual information often augments textual data in ways that text-only models struggle to harness effectively. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisualWebArena, a benchmark designed to assess the performance of multimodal web agents on realistic visually grounded tasks. VisualWebArena comprises of a set of diverse and complex webbased tasks that evaluate various capabilities of autonomous multimodal agents. To perform on this benchmark, agents need to accurately process image-text inputs, interpret natural language instructions, and execute actions on websites to accomplish user-defined objectives. We conduct an extensive evaluation of stateof-the-art LLM-based autonomous agents, including several multimodal models. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we identify several limitations of text-only LLM agents, and reveal gaps in the capabilities of state-ofthe-art multimodal language agents. VisualWebArena provides a framework for evaluating multimodal autonomous language agents, and offers insights towards building stronger autonomous agents for the web. Our code, baseline models, and data is publicly available at https://jykoh.com/vwa.},

  abstract = {Systematic reviews and systematic maps represent powerful tools to identify, collect, evaluate and summarise primary research pertinent to a specific research question or topic in a highly standardised and reproducible manner. Even though they are seen as the ``gold standard''when synthesising primary research, systematic reviews and maps are typically resource-intensive and complex activities. Thus, managing the conduct and reporting of such reviews can become a time consuming and challenging task. This paper introduces the open access online tool CADIMA, which was developed through a collaboration between the Julius K{\"u}hn-Institut and the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence, in order to increase the efficiency of the evidence synthesis process and facilitate reporting of all activities to maximise methodological rigour. Furthermore, we analyse how CADIMA compares with other available tools by providing a comprehensive summary of existing software designed for the purposes of systematic review management. We show that CADIMA is the only available open access tool that is designed to: (1) assist throughout the systematic review/map process; (2) be suited to reviews broader than medical sciences; (3) allow for offline data extraction; and, (4) support working as a review team.},

Trust is a rich and complex construct which has sparked a multitude of measures and approaches to study and understand it. This comprehensive narrative review addresses known methods that have been used to capture TiA. We examined measurements deployed in existing empirical works, categorized those measures into self-report, behavioral, and physiological indices, and examined them within the context of an existing model of trust. The resulting work provides a reference guide for researchers, providing a list of available TiA measurement methods along with the model-derived constructs that they capture including judgments of trustworthiness, trust attitudes, and trusting behaviors. The article concludes with recommendations on how to improve the current state of TiA measurement.},

  abstract = {Voice based human--computer interactions have raised much interest and found various applications. Some extant voice based interactions only support voice commands with fixed vocabularies or preset expressions. This paper is motivated to investigate an approach to implement a flexible voice-enabled CAD system, where users are no longer constrained by predefined commands. Designers can, to a much more flexible degree, communicate with CAD modelers using natural language conversations. To accomplish this, a knowledge-guided approach is proposed to infer the semantics of voice input. The semantic inference is formulated as a template matching problem, where the semantic units parsed from voice input are the ``samples'' to be inspected and the semantic units in the predefined library are the feature templates. The proposed behavioral glosses, together with CAD-specific synonyms, hyponyms and hypernyms are extensively used in the parsing of semantic units and the subsequent template matching. Using such sources of knowledge, all the semantically equivalent expressions can be mapped to the same command set, and the Voice-enabled Computer Aided Design (VeCAD) system is then capable of processing new expressions it has never encountered and inferring/understanding the semantics at runtime. Experiments show that this knowledge-guided approach is helpful to enhance the robustness of semantic inference and can effectively eliminate the chance of overestimations and underestimations in design intent interpretation.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in email spam detection by comparing prominent models from three distinct families: BERT-like, Sentence Transformers, and Seq2Seq. Additionally, we examine well-established machine learning techniques for spam detection, such as Na{\textbackslash}"ive Bayes and LightGBM, as baseline methods. We assess the performance of these models across four public datasets, utilizing different numbers of training samples (full training set and few-shot settings). Our findings reveal that, in the majority of cases, LLMs surpass the performance of the popular baseline techniques, particularly in few-shot scenarios. This adaptability renders LLMs uniquely suited to spam detection tasks, where labeled samples are limited in number and models require frequent updates. Additionally, we introduce Spam-T5, a Flan-T5 model that has been specifically adapted and fine-tuned for the purpose of detecting email spam. Our results demonstrate that Spam-T5 surpasses baseline models and other LLMs in the majority of scenarios, particularly when there are a limited number of training samples available. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/jpmorganchase/emailspamdetection.},

Although guidelines have been proposed, there is not yet an established set of usability heuristics to guide and evaluate conversational agent design. In this paper, we propose a set of heuristics for conversational agents adapted from Nielsen's heuristics and based on expert feedback. We then validate the heuristics through two rounds of evaluations conducted by participants on two conversational agents, one chatbot and one voice-based personal assistant. We find that, when using our heuristics to evaluate both interfaces, evaluators were able to identify more usability issues than when using Nielsen's heuristics. We propose that our heuristics successfully identify issues related to dialogue content, interaction design, help and guidance, human-like characteristics, and data privacy.},

However, many practitioners do not emphasize user needs sufficiently and neglect user involvement in software design and development. The UCD Sprint is a recently proposed, step-by-step, cost-effective process that focuses on involving users in design activities. This article reports a mixed-method study in which, for the first time, practitioners working in companies used the UCD Sprint; the study's main objective was to investigate the impact of the UCD Sprint on practitioners' design practices. The results show that, among the various activities associated with this process, those that involved users were particularly appreciated by practitioners. Thus, the UCD Sprint can enhance the innovativeness of company design practices; it enables practi\- tioners to obtain sufficient information to create systems that fit users' needs.},

In this paper, we report a survey that gathered the views on UX of 275 researchers and practitioners from academia and industry. Most respondents agree that UX is dynamic, context-dependent, and subjective. With respect to the more controversial issues, the authors propose to delineate UX as something individual (instead of social) that emerges from interacting with a product, system, service or an object. The draft ISO definition on UX seems to be in line with the survey findings, although the issues of experiencing anticipated use and the object of UX will require further explication. The outcome of this survey lays ground for understanding, scoping, and defining the concept of user experience.},

  abstract = {In this paper we describe a Wizard of Oz (WOz) user study of an Augmented Reality (AR) interface that uses multimodal input (MMI) with natural hand interaction and speech commands. Our goal is to use a WOz study to help guide the creation of a multimodal AR interface which is most natural to the user. In this study we used three virtual object arranging tasks with two different display types (a head mounted display, and a desktop monitor) to see how users used multimodal commands, and how different AR display conditions affect those commands. The results provided valuable insights into how people naturally interact in a multimodal AR scene assembly task. For example, we discovered the optimal time frame for fusing speech and gesture commands into a single command. We also found that display type did not produce a significant difference in the type of commands used. Using these results, we present design recommendations for multimodal interaction in AR environments.},

  abstract = {Interacting with a computer requires adopting some metaphor to guide our actions and expectations. Most human-computer interfaces can be classified according to two dominant metaphors: (1) agent and (2) environment. Interactions based on an agent metaphor treat the computer as an intermediary that responds to user requests. In the environment metaphor, a model of the task domain is presented for the user to interact with directly. The term agent has come to refer to the automation of aspects of human-computer interaction (HCI), such as anticipating commands or autonomously performing actions. Norman's 1984 model of HCI is introduced as reference to organize and evaluate research in human-agent interaction (HAI). A wide variety of heterogeneous research involving HAI is shown to reflect automation of one of the stages of action or evaluation within Norman's model. Improvements in HAI are expected to result from a more heterogeneous use of methods that target multiple stages simultaneously.},

  abstract = {With the increasing popularity of machine learning, the demand for users to develop machine learning applications has grown rapidly, which brings about a rising growth for end-user development (EUD) method research. Based on previous works, EUD can be roughly divided into two categories: methods with coding and without coding (i.e. no-code). In recent years, no-code and low-code methods have become the mainstream EUD methods that have been widely concerned by the education and business community, due to their low technical barriers. However, there lacks a comprehensive summary of existing research to answer some fundamental questions, such as: How can no/low-code platform help end-users develop ML applications? what are their effects, design methods, and user experience? This paper answers the above questions through a systematic literature review. Two experienced researchers carefully read, coded, analyzed, and checked the literature by using MAXQDA, the results showed:1. No-code or low-code tools can already support the development pipeline of ML applications that traditionally requires coding. 2. No-code or low-code methods are preferred by users. 3. For design purposes, the visual development method is the most commonly used form, especially in the field of education. 4. In terms of interactive experience, a few design principles were recognized from the reviewed pieces of literature, including the interactive process should provide a low threshold, high ceiling, and wide walls; the information architecture should meet the mental model of the novice user's cognitive process; the platform functions should support rapid prototyping, iterations, and timely feedback.},

We used factorial surveys with a 2 {\texttimes} 2 mixed design to compare user perceptions when a guideline is applied versus violated, under conditions of optimal versus sub-optimal AI performance. The results provided both qualitative and quantitative insights into the UX impact of each guideline. These insights can support creators of user-facing AI systems in their nuanced prioritization and application of the guidelines.},

While many recognize the necessity to incorporate explainability features in AI systems, how to address real-world user needs for understanding AI remains an open question. By interviewing 20 UX and design practitioners working on various AI products, we seek to identify gaps between the current XAI algorithmic work and practices to create explainable AI products. To do so, we develop an algorithm-informed XAI question bank in which user needs for explainability are represented as prototypical questions users might ask about the AI, and use it as a study probe. Our work contributes insights into the design space of XAI, informs efforts to support design practices in this space, and identifies opportunities for future XAI work. We also provide an extended XAI question bank and discuss how it can be used for creating user-centered XAI.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the field of explainable AI (XAI) has produced a vast collection of algorithms, providing a useful toolbox for researchers and practitioners to build XAI applications. With the rich application opportunities, explainability is believed to have moved beyond a demand by data scientists or researchers to comprehend the models they develop, to an essential requirement for people to trust and adopt AI deployed in numerous domains. However, explainability is an inherently human-centric property and the field is starting to embrace human-centered approaches. Human-computer interaction (HCI) research and user experience (UX) design in this area are becoming increasingly important. In this chapter, we begin with a high-level overview of the technical landscape of XAI algorithms, then selectively survey our own and other recent HCI works that take human-centered approaches to design, evaluate, and provide conceptual and methodological tools for XAI. We ask the question "what are human-centered approaches doing for XAI" and highlight three roles that they play in shaping XAI technologies by helping navigate, assess and expand the XAI toolbox: to drive technical choices by users' explainability needs, to uncover pitfalls of existing XAI methods and inform new methods, and to provide conceptual frameworks for human-compatible XAI.},

  abstract = {Transformers have achieved great success in many artificial intelligence fields, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing. Therefore, it is natural to attract lots of interest from academic and industry researchers. Up to the present, a great variety of Transformer variants (a.k.a. X-formers) have been proposed, however, a systematic and comprehensive literature review on these Transformer variants is still missing. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of various X-formers. We first briefly introduce the vanilla Transformer and then propose a new taxonomy of X-formers. Next, we introduce the various X-formers from three perspectives: architectural modification, pre-training, and applications. Finally, we outline some potential directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes ("neurons"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges ("weights"). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.},

Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook have all embedded proprietary CAs within their software and, increasingly, conversation is becoming a key mode of human-computer interaction. Whilst we have long been familiar with the notion of computers that speak, the investigative concern within HCI has been upon multimodality rather than dialogue alone, and there is no sense of how such interfaces are used in everyday life. This paper reports the findings of interviews with 14 users of CAs in an effort to understand the current interactional factors affecting everyday use. We find user expectations dramatically out of step with the operation of the systems, particularly in terms of known machine intelligence, system capability and goals. Using Norman's 'gulfs of execution and evaluation' [30] we consider the implications of these findings for the design of future systems.},

  abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

We contribute to this growing body of work by describing and analysing the perspectives of people and organisations who made submissions in response to Australia's proposed 'AI Ethics Framework', the first framework of its kind to include 'contestability' as a core ethical principle. Our findings reveal that while the nature of contestability is disputed, it is seen as a way to protect individuals, and it resembles contestability in relation to human decision-making.

  abstract = {Recent neural language models have taken a significant step forward in producing remarkably controllable, fluent, and grammatical text. Although studies have found that AI-generated text is not distinguishable from human-written text for crowd-sourcing workers, there still exist errors in AI-generated text which are even subtler and harder to spot. We primarily focus on the scenario in which scientific AI writing assistant is deeply involved. First, we construct a feature description framework to distinguish between AIgenerated text and human-written text from syntax, semantics, and pragmatics based on the human evaluation. Then we utilize the features, i.e., writing style, coherence, consistency, and argument logistics, from the proposed framework to analyze two types of content. Finally, we adopt several publicly available methods to investigate the gap of between AI-generated scientific text and human-written scientific text by AI-generated scientific text detection models. The results suggest that while AI has the potential to generate scientific content that is as accurate as human-written content, there is still a gap in terms of depth and overall quality. The AI-generated scientific content is more likely to contain errors in factual issues. We find that there exists a ``writing style'' gap between AI-generated scientific text and human-written scientific text. Based on the analysis result, we summarize a series of model-agnostic and distribution-agnostic features for detection tasks in other domains. Findings in this paper contribute to guiding the optimization of AI models to produce high-quality content and addressing related ethical and security concerns.},

  abstract = {Background               The increasing development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in medicine driven by researchers and entrepreneurs goes along with enormous expectations for medical care advancement. AI might change the clinical practice of physicians from almost all medical disciplines and in most areas of health care. While expectations for AI in medicine are high, practical implementations of AI for clinical practice are still scarce in Germany. Moreover, physicians' requirements and expectations of AI in medicine and their opinion on the usage of anonymized patient data for clinical and biomedical research have not been investigated widely in German university hospitals.                                         Objective               This study aimed to evaluate physicians' requirements and expectations of AI in medicine and their opinion on the secondary usage of patient data for (bio)medical research (eg, for the development of machine learning algorithms) in university hospitals in Germany.                                         Methods               A web-based survey was conducted addressing physicians of all medical disciplines in 8 German university hospitals. Answers were given using Likert scales and general demographic responses. Physicians were asked to participate locally via email in the respective hospitals.                                         Results               The online survey was completed by 303 physicians (female: 121/303, 39.9\%; male: 173/303, 57.1\%; no response: 9/303, 3.0\%) from a wide range of medical disciplines and work experience levels. Most respondents either had a positive (130/303, 42.9\%) or a very positive attitude (82/303, 27.1\%) towards AI in medicine. There was a significant association between the personal rating of AI in medicine and the self-reported technical affinity level (H4=48.3, P{$<$}.001). A vast majority of physicians expected the future of medicine to be a mix of human and artificial intelligence (273/303, 90.1\%) but also requested a scientific evaluation before the routine implementation of AI-based systems (276/303, 91.1\%). Physicians were most optimistic that AI applications would identify drug interactions (280/303, 92.4\%) to improve patient care substantially but were quite reserved regarding AI-supported diagnosis of psychiatric diseases (62/303, 20.5\%). Of the respondents, 82.5\% (250/303) agreed that there should be open access to anonymized patient databases for medical and biomedical research.                                         Conclusions               Physicians in stationary patient care in German university hospitals show a generally positive attitude towards using most AI applications in medicine. Along with this optimism comes several expectations and hopes that AI will assist physicians in clinical decision making. Especially in fields of medicine where huge amounts of data are processed (eg, imaging procedures in radiology and pathology) or data are collected continuously (eg, cardiology and intensive care medicine), physicians' expectations of AI to substantially improve future patient care are high. In the study, the greatest potential was seen in the application of AI for the identification of drug interactions, assumedly due to the rising complexity of drug administration to polymorbid, polypharmacy patients. However, for the practical usage of AI in health care, regulatory and organizational challenges still have to be mastered.},

In such a context, stakeholders with different roles and competencies collaborate to manage and control an environment where legacy machines coexist and interact with newer ones. Our goal is to provide a rule-based tool that allows end-users to build personalised solutions to respond quickly to the dynamic needs of factories. We report on a case study in the paper factory domain, in which the industrial aspects identified with expert stakeholders through interviews have been simulated and addressed through an extension of a personalisation platform. A first user test of the resulting environment has been carried out with a representative set of users, and has provided useful and encouraging feedback in terms of the potentialities of the proposed approach in industrial contexts.},

Despite this, the adoption of highly automated driving by the public is not guaranteed yet, and trust in vehicle automation seems to play an important role in drivers' behaviour and acceptance. The goal of the current paper is to (1) present general concepts related to trust and trust in automation, (2) summarize and compare theoretical models concerning trust in automation proposed in recent years, (3) present a systematic review of studies dealing with trust in automated driving from the driver point of view, and organize these trust-influencing factors following an already established classification, and finally (4) synthetize and discuss the previously presented findings and their practical implications.},

It explores how exactly the `human-in-the loop' paradigm can be pursued and relevant core AI concepts and approaches. The chapter discusses six concepts and tools that are fundamental in systematically pursuing a human-centered approach to AI, explaining its role and contributions to the overall goal of human-centered AI. These concepts are explainable AI and human-in-the-loop; semantic, cognitive, and perceptual computing; visual predictive analytics; interactive machine learning; federated learning; and UX design for AI. Federated learning promotes decentralized machine learning, engaging everyday devices owned and used by everybody for the benefit and improvement of AI. The chapter concludes by discussing a roadmap of research activities in order to pursue the approach of `HCD for AI' in a systematic manner.},

  abstract = {Interaction designers often have difficulty understanding people's real-world experiences with ubiquitous systems. The automobile is a great example of these challenges, where on-road testing is time-consuming and provides little ability for rapid prototyping of interface behavior. We introduce WoZ Way, a system to connect designers to remote drivers. We use live video, audio, car data, and Wizard of Oz speech and interfaces to enable remote observation and interaction prototyping on the road. Our implementation integrates environmental, system level, and social information to make the invisible visible. We tested across three example deployments highlighting usage in interaction prototyping and observational studies. Our findings illustrate how designers explored the situated experiences of people on the road, and how they experimented with different improvisational Wizard of Oz interactions. WoZ Way is both a design research and a design prototyping tool, which can support the work of interaction designers through naturalistic observations, contextual inquiry, and responsive interaction prototyping.},

  abstract = {AI-based systems are software systems with functionalities enabled by at least one AI component (e.g., for image-, speech-recognition, and autonomous driving). AI-based systems are becoming pervasive in society due to advances in AI. However, there is limited synthesized knowledge on Software Engineering (SE) approaches for building, operating, and maintaining AI-based systems. To collect and analyze state-of-the-art knowledge about SE for AI-based systems, we conducted a systematic mapping study. We considered 248 studies published between January 2010 and March 2020. SE for AI-based systems is an emerging research area, where more than 2/3 of the studies have been published since 2018. The most studied properties of AI-based systems are dependability and safety. We identified multiple SE approaches for AI-based systems, which we classified according to the SWEBOK areas. Studies related to software testing and software quality are very prevalent, while areas like software maintenance seem neglected. Data-related issues are the most recurrent challenges. Our results are valuable for: researchers, to quickly understand the state-of-the-art and learn which topics need more research; practitioners, to learn about the approaches and challenges that SE entails for AI-based systems; and, educators, to bridge the gap among SE and AI in their curricula.},

Of course, users are often looking directly at the object or place of interest ? fine-grained, contextual information that is currently unused. We present WorldGaze, a software-only method for smartphones that provides the real-world gaze address of a user that voice agents can utilize for rapid, natural, and precise interactions. We achieve this by simultaneously opening the front and rear cameras of a smartphone. The front-facing camera is used to track the head in 3D, including estimating its direction vector. As the geometry of the front and back cameras are fixed and known, we can raycast the head vector into the 3D world scene as captured by the rear-facing camera. This allows the user to intuitively define an object or region of interest using their head gaze. We started our investigations with a qualitative exploration of competing methods, before developing a functional, real-time implementation. We conclude with an evaluation that shows WorldGaze can be quick and accurate, opening new multimodal gaze+voice interactions for mobile voice agents.},

What chatbot personalities are most compelling to young, urban users in India? To explore this question, we first conducted exploratory Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) studies with 14 users that simulated interactions with a hypothetical chatbot. We evaluated three personalities for the chatbot---Maya, a productivity oriented bot with nerd wit; Ada, a fun, flirtatious bot; and Evi, an emotional buddy bot. We followed up with one-on-one interviews with the users discussing their experiences with each of the chatbots, what they liked, and what they did not. Overall our results show that users wanted a chatbot like Maya, who could add value to their life while being a friend, by making useful recommendations. But they also wanted preferred traits of Ada and Evi infused into Maya.},

  abstract = {With the widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems and applications in our everyday lives, accounting for fairness has gained significant importance in designing and engineering of such systems. AI systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that these decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. More recently some work has been developed in traditional machine learning and deep learning that address such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming more aware of the biases that these applications can contain and are attempting to address them. In this survey, we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and ways they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems. We are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to tackle these issues in the near future by observing existing work in their respective fields.},

Moderators on social media platforms need to be technologically supported to detect problematic content and react accordingly. In this article, we develop and discuss the design principles that are best suited for creating efficient user interfaces for decision support systems that use artificial intelligence (AI) to assist human moderators. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated various design options over three design cycles with a total of 641 participants. Besides measuring perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to use, we also conducted an experiment to prove the significant influence of AI explainability on end users' perceived cognitive efforts, perceived informativeness, mental model, and trustworthiness in AI. Finally, we tested the acquired design knowledge with software developers, who rated the reusability of the proposed design principles as high.},

To this aim, the state-of-the-art method SparkGHSOM was considered to learn predictive models for normal (i.e. regular) scenarios of air quality and traffic jams in a distributed fashion. Furthermore, we extended the main algorithm to make the detected anomalies explainable through an instance-based feature ranking approach. The results showed that SparkGHSOM is able to detect anomalies for both the real applications considered in this study, despite the fact it was designed for different tasks.},

  abstract = {There has been a recent resurgence in the area of explainable artificial intelligence as researchers and practitioners seek to provide more transparency to their algorithms. Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a `good' explanation. There exist vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations to the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence can build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.},

  annotation = {Abstract note: Models that top leaderboards often perform unsatisfactorily when deployed in real world applications; this has necessitated rigorous and expensive pre-deployment model testing. A hitherto unexplored facet of model performance is: Are our leaderboards doing equitable evaluation? In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic method to probe leaderboards by weighting samples based on their 'difficulty' level. We find that leaderboards can be adversarially attacked and top performing models may not always be the best models. We subsequently propose alternate evaluation metrics. Our experiments on 10 models show changes in model ranking and an overall reduction in previously reported performance- thus rectifying the overestimation of AI systems' capabilities. Inspired by behavioral testing principles, we further develop a prototype of a visual analytics tool that enables leaderboard revamping through customization, based on an end user's focus area. This helps users analyze models' strengths and weaknesses, and guides them in the selection of a model best suited for their application scenario. In a user study, members of various commercial product development teams, covering 5 focus areas, find that our prototype reduces pre-deployment development and testing effort by 41\% on average.},

Explainable AI               (               XAI               ) systems are intended to self-explain the reasoning behind system decisions and predictions. Researchers from different disciplines work together to define, design, and evaluate explainable systems. However, scholars from different disciplines focus on different objectives and fairly independent topics of XAI research, which poses challenges for identifying appropriate design and evaluation methodology and consolidating knowledge across efforts. To this end, this article presents a survey and framework intended to share knowledge and experiences of XAI design and evaluation methods across multiple disciplines. Aiming to support diverse design goals and evaluation methods in XAI research, after a thorough review of XAI related papers in the fields of machine learning, visualization, and human-computer interaction, we present a categorization of XAI design goals and evaluation methods. Our categorization presents the mapping between design goals for different XAI user groups and their evaluation methods. From our findings, we develop a framework with step-by-step design guidelines paired with evaluation methods to close the iterative design and evaluation cycles in multidisciplinary XAI teams. Further, we provide summarized ready-to-use tables of evaluation methods and recommendations for different goals in XAI research.},

  abstract = {With recent advances in natural language understanding techniques and farfield microphone arrays, natural language interfaces, such as voice assistants and chatbots, are emerging as a popular new way to interact with computers. They have made their way out of the industry research labs and into the pockets, desktops, cars and living rooms of the general public. But although such interfaces recognize bits of natural language, and even voice input, they generally lack conversational competence, or the ability to engage in natural conversation. Today's platforms provide sophisticated tools for analyzing language and retrieving knowledge, but they fail to provide adequate support for modeling interaction. The user experience (UX) designer or software developer must figure out how a human conversation is organized, usually relying on commonsense rather than on formal knowledge. Fortunately, practitioners can rely on conversation science.This book adapts formal knowledge from the field of Conversation Analysis (CA) to the design of natural language interfaces. It outlines the Natural Conversation Framework (NCF), developed at IBM Research, a systematic framework for designing interfaces that work like natural conversation. The NCF consists of four main components: 1) an interaction model of "expandable sequences," 2) a corresponding content format, 3) a pattern language with 100 generic UX patterns and 4) a navigation method of six basic user actions. The authors introduce UX designers to a new way of thinking about user experience design in the context of conversational interfaces, including a new vocabulary, new principles and new interaction patterns. User experience designers and graduate students in the HCI field as well as developers and conversation analysis students should find this book of interest.},

Our analysis spans several measurable linguistic dimensions, including morphological, syntactic, psychometric and sociolinguistic aspects. The results reveal various measurable differences between human and AI-generated texts. Among others, human texts exhibit more scattered sentence length distributions, a distinct use of dependency and constituent types, shorter constituents, and more aggressive emotions (fear, disgust) than LLM-generated texts. LLM outputs use more numbers, symbols and auxiliaries (suggesting objective language) than human texts, as well as more pronouns. The sexist bias prevalent in human text is also expressed by LLMs.},

  abstract = {As Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) become widely popular, designers must handle new usability challenges. However, compared to other established domains such as Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), VUI designers have fewer resources (training support, usability heuristics, design patterns) to guide them. On the other hand, GUI-trained designers may also be solicited upon to design VUIs given the increased demand for such interfaces. This raises the question: how can we best support such designers as they transition from GUI to VUI design? To answer this, we focus on usability heuristics as a key resource, and conduct several workshops with GUI design experts, exploring how they map their design experience onto VUI design. Based on this, we suggest that the ``path of least resistance'' to transitioning designers from GUI to VUI may be the adaptation of familiar resources and concepts (such as GUI heuristics) to the VUI design space, instead of the imposition of novel VUI-specific heuristics on GUI-trained designers. This finding can inform the development of design resources that can support the increase demand for VUIs.},

  abstract = {Web usability is a critical factor for visitors' acceptance and satisfaction. The prevalence of various free and proprietary website testing tools enabled the fast evaluation of the usability of websites. However, their effectiveness in providing meaningful, consistent, and valid results remains questionable. In this study, we initially devised a usability framework that incorporates 19 usability dimensions and investigated the compliance of 10 popular web usability testing tools to this framework. Next, we applied the automated evaluation to nine websites spanning three major categories, namely e-commerce, vacation rentals, and education. On a positive note, the tools inspected a wide range of aspects, including performance, SEO, page size, accessibility, and security. However, our in-depth analysis revealed numerous critical issues. First, usability seems to be ignored or distorted by most of the tools. Second, the automated tools exhibited variable and contradictory scores concerning the analysis of the same websites. Third, the analysis reports were vague and complicated for non-technical users. Fourth, the tools identified and explained issues affecting the technical implementation of the websites, overlooking web usability flaws. Fifth, only four tools (i.e., SEOptimiser, Dareboost, Website Grader, and Sure Oak) gave recommendations to remedy performance bottlenecks and improve the quality of the websites. Lastly, the inner working of the tools does not seem to incorporate the theoretical foundations of usability, which calls for urgent collaboration between industry experts and HCI practitioners and researchers.},

  abstract = {The existing interfaces for 3D CAD modeling softwares use 2D subspace inputs such as x and y axes of mouse to create 3D models. These existing interfaces are inherently modal because one needs to switch between subspaces, and disconnects the input space from modeling space. This makes existing interfaces tedious, complex, non-intuitive and difficult to learn. In this paper, a multi-sensory, interactive, and intuitive 3D CAD modeling interface is presented to address these shortcomings. Three different modalities (gestures, brain-computer interface, and speech) have been used for creating interactive and intuitive 3D CAD modeling interface. DepthSense{\textregistered} camera from SoftKinetic is used to recognize gestures, EEG Neuro-headset from Emotiv{\textregistered} is used for acquiring, and processing neuro-signals and CMU Sphinx is used for recognizing and processing speech. Multiple CAD models created by several users using the proposed multi-modal interface are presented. In conclusion, the proposed system is easier to learn and use as compared to the already existing systems.},

  abstract = {Brain tumors are most common in children and the elderly. It is a serious form of cancer caused by uncontrollable brain cell growth inside the skull. Tumor cells are notoriously difficult to classify due to their heterogeneity. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most widely used machine learning algorithm for visual learning and brain tumor recognition. This study proposed a CNN-based dense EfficientNet using min-max normalization to classify 3260 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance images into four categories (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor). The developed network is a variant of EfficientNet with dense and drop-out layers added. Similarly, the authors combined data augmentation with min-max normalization to increase the contrast of tumor cells. The benefit of the dense CNN model is that it can accurately categorize a limited database of pictures. As a result, the proposed approach provides exceptional overall performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model was 99.97\% accurate during training and 98.78\% accurate during testing. With high accuracy and a favorable F1 score, the newly designed EfficientNet CNN architecture can be a useful decision-making tool in the study of brain tumor diagnostic tests.},

  abstract = {Attention has arguably become one of the most important concepts in the deep learning field. It is inspired by the biological systems of humans that tend to focus on the distinctive parts when processing large amounts of information. With the development of deep neural networks, attention mechanism has been widely used in diverse application domains. This paper aims to give an overview of the state-of-the-art attention models proposed in recent years. Toward a better general understanding of attention mechanisms, we define a unified model that is suitable for most attention structures. Each step of the attention mechanism implemented in the model is described in detail. Furthermore, we classify existing attention models according to four criteria: the softness of attention, forms of input feature, input representation, and output representation. Besides, we summarize network architectures used in conjunction with the attention mechanism and describe some typical applications of attention mechanism. Finally, we discuss the interpretability that attention brings to deep learning and present its potential future trends.},

  abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic led to profound changes in the organization of health care systems worldwide. Aims We sought to measure the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the volumes for mechanical thrombectomy, stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage hospitalizations over a three-month period at the height of the pandemic (1 March--31 May 2020) compared with two control three-month periods (immediately preceding and one year prior). Methods Retrospective, observational, international study, across 6 continents, 40 countries, and 187 comprehensive stroke centers. The diagnoses were identified by their ICD-10 codes and/or classifications in stroke databases at participating centers. Results The hospitalization volumes for any stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and mechanical thrombectomy were 26,699, 4002, and 5191 in the three months immediately before versus 21,576, 3540, and 4533 during the first three pandemic months, representing declines of 19.2\% (95\%CI, -19.7 to -18.7), 11.5\% (95\%CI, -12.6 to -10.6), and 12.7\% (95\%CI, -13.6 to -11.8), respectively. The decreases were noted across centers with high, mid, and low COVID-19 hospitalization burden, and also across high, mid, and low volume stroke/mechanical thrombectomy centers. High-volume COVID-19 centers (-20.5\%) had greater declines in mechanical thrombectomy volumes than mid- (-10.1\%) and low-volume (-8.7\%) centers (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). There was a 1.5\% stroke rate across 54,366 COVID-19 hospitalizations. SARS-CoV-2 infection was noted in 3.9\% (784/20,250) of all stroke admissions. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a global decline in the volume of overall stroke hospitalizations, mechanical thrombectomy procedures, and intracranial hemorrhage admission volumes. Despite geographic variations, these volume reductions were observed regardless of COVID-19 hospitalization burden and pre-pandemic stroke/mechanical thrombectomy volumes.},

We present a machine learning experiment aimed at recognizing emotions during programming tasks using wearable biometric sensors, tracking electrodermal activity and heart-related metrics. As a gold standard for supervised learning, we rely on a state-of-the-art tool for emotion recognition based on facial expression analysis. We design, implement and evaluate an approach that combines the output of two classifiers for neutral valence recognition and positive/negative polarity classification. Our findings suggest that biometric sensors in a wristband can be used to identify emotions whose recognition would otherwise need an intrusive webcam.},

As those develop, issues of usability have also been spotted that underline the fact that the way we are used to designing interfaces do not apply directly to voice interactions. Since heuristic and ergonomic criteria are the first way designers can improve their interfaces, we propose a new set of criteria for VUIs, based for the first time on an extensive review of academic and professional guidelines, and plugged into existing general heuristics. These criteria underline the need for VUIs to make up for the lack of visual cues, to take into account the social nature of conversations, as well as the need to own the fact that talking objects will be interpreted as full characters with a personality, and therefore need to be designed as such.},

  abstract = {eXplainable AI (XAI) involves two intertwined but separate challenges: the development of techniques to extract explanations from black-box AI models and the way such explanations are presented to users, i.e., the explanation user interface. Despite its importance, the second aspect has received limited attention so far in the literature. Effective AI explanation interfaces are fundamental for allowing human decision-makers to take advantage and oversee high-risk AI systems effectively. Following an iterative design approach, we present the first cycle of prototyping-testing-redesigning of an explainable AI technique and its explanation user interface for clinical Decision Support Systems (DSS). We first present an XAI technique that meets the technical requirements of the healthcare domain: sequential, ontology-linked patient data, and multi-label classification tasks. We demonstrate its applicability to explain a clinical DSS, and we design a first prototype of an explanation user interface. Next, we test such a prototype with healthcare providers and collect their feedback with a two-fold outcome: First, we obtain evidence that explanations increase users' trust in the XAI system, and second, we obtain useful insights on the perceived deficiencies of their interaction with the system, so we can re-design a better, more human-centered explanation interface.},

  abstract = {Objective: Our aim was to review empirical studies of complacency and bias in human interaction with automated and decision support systems and provide an integrated theoretical model for their explanation. Background: Automation-related complacency and automation bias have typically been considered separately and independently. Methods: Studies on complacency and automation bias were analyzed with respect to the cognitive processes involved. Results: Automation complacency occurs under conditions of multiple-task load, when manual tasks compete with the automated task for the operator's attention. Automation complacency is found in both naive and expert participants and cannot be overcome with simple practice.Automation bias results in making both omission and commission errors when decision aids are imperfect.Automation bias occurs in both naive and expert participants, cannot be prevented by training or instructions, and can affect decision making in individuals as well as in teams.While automation bias has been conceived of as a special case of decision bias, our analysis suggests that it also depends on attentional processes similar to those involved in automation-related complacency. Conclusion: Complacency and automation bias represent different manifestations of overlapping automationinduced phenomena, with attention playing a central role. An integrated model of complacency and automation bias shows that they result from the dynamic interaction of personal, situational, and automation-related characteristics.},

  abstract = {The combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made it possible to introduce numerous automations in our daily environments. Many new interesting possibilities and opportunities have been enabled, but there are also risks and problems. Often these problems originated from approaches that have not been able to consider the users' viewpoint sufficiently. We need to empower people in order to actually understand the automations in their surroundings environments, modify them, and create new ones, even if they have no programming knowledge. It is thus important that the curricula of programs in several disciplines (artificial intelligence, computer science, human-computer interaction, psychology, design, {\dots}) discuss these problems and some possible solutions able to provide people with the possibility to control and create their daily automations. In this paper I propose a possible way to organise and structure teaching of the concepts, methods and tools for this purpose, and which can be adopted in the relevant curricula.},

Automated phishing detection enables email clients to warn users that an email is suspicious, but current warnings are often not specific. We evaluated the effects on phishing susceptibility of (1) moving phishing warnings close to the suspicious link in the email, (2) displaying the warning on hover interactions with the link, and (3) forcing attention to the warning by deactivating the original link, forcing users to click the URL in the warning. We assessed the effectiveness of such link-focused phishing warning designs in a between-subjects online experiment (n=701). We found that link-focused phishing warnings reduced phishing click-through rates compared to email banner warnings; forced attention warnings were most effective. We discuss the implications of our findings for phishing warning design.},

This distribution approximately follows a simple mathematical form known as Zipf 's law. This article first shows that human language has a highly complex, reliable structure in the frequency distribution over and above this classic law, although prior data visualization methods have obscured this fact. A number of empirical phenomena related to word frequencies are then reviewed. These facts are chosen to be informative about the mechanisms giving rise to Zipf's law and are then used to evaluate many of the theoretical explanations of Zipf's law in language. No prior account straightforwardly explains all the basic facts or is supported with independent evaluation of its underlying assumptions. To make progress at understanding why language obeys Zipf's law, studies must seek evidence beyond the law itself, testing assumptions and evaluating novel predictions with new, independent data.},

In this scenario, we present DSBot, an assistant that can analyze the user data and produce answers by mastering several Data Science techniques. DSBot understands the research question with the help of conversation interaction, produces a data science pipeline and automatically executes the pipeline in order to generate analysis. The strength of DSBot lies in the design of a rich domain specific language for modeling data analysis pipelines, the use of a suitable neural network for machine translation of research questions, the availability of a vast dictionary of pipelines for matching the translation output, and the use of natural language technology provided by a conversational agent. We empirically evaluated the translation capabilities and the autoML performances of the system. In the translation task, it obtains a BLEU score of 0.8. In prediction tasks, DSBot outperforms TPOT, an autoML tool, in 19 datasets out of 30.},

Yet despite the popularity of CBI material, there is a gap in understanding of the relationship between multimedia and learning. Kozma (1994) argues that any understanding of the relationship between media and learning must be grounded in cognitive and social processes associated with knowledge construction. Due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between learning and multimedia, the incentive for developing CBI packages has been the innovative alternative in information technology for presenting instructional material rather than learning theories (Ambron and Hooper, 1990). Hence, Hedberg, Harper and Brown (1993) have called for a closer examination of ways in which information is accessed and processed in current learning packages as a basis for designing CBI packages for effective learning outcomes.DOI:10.1080/0968776980060203},

The audio signal is captured and automatically transcribed to a textual 3D note, which is attached to the geometry and made available to other product information and business processes across the enterprise via a product data management system. Our approach provides a more natural and intuitive method to capture design and engineering knowledge that is particularly effective when large amounts of information need to be communicated. We discuss the rationale of the software architecture and the value of this modality for capturing knowledge in a collaborative engineering context. Finally, we examine the results of an experiment to validate our proposal. Our results show that 3D annotations are an effective mechanism to communicate design knowledge, which suggests the need for further developments in the areas of multimodal interaction methods and interfaces for CAD and collaborative tools.},

  abstract = {Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) are becoming ubiquitously available, being embedded both into everyday mobility via smartphones, and into the life of the home via 'assistant' devices. Yet, exactly how users of such devices practically thread that use into their everyday social interactions remains underexplored. By collecting and studying audio data from month-long deployments of the Amazon Echo in participants' homes-informed by ethnomethodology and conversation analysis-our study documents the methodical practices of VUI users, and how that use is accomplished in the complex social life of the home. Data we present shows how the device is made accountable to and embedded into conversational settings like family dinners where various simultaneous activities are being achieved. We discuss how the VUI is finely coordinated with the sequential organisation of talk. Finally, we locate implications for the accountability of VUI interaction, request and response design, and raise conceptual challenges to the notion of designing 'conversational' interfaces.},

  abstract = {The need for AI systems to provide explanations for their behaviour is now widely recognised as key to their adoption. In this article, we examine the problem of trustworthy AI and explore what delivering this means in practice, with a focus on healthcare applications. Work in this area typically treats trustworthy AI as a problem of Human--Computer Interaction involving the individual user and an AI system. However, we argue here that this overlooks the important part played by organisational accountability in how people reason about and trust AI in socio-technical settings. To illustrate the importance of organisational accountability, we present findings from ethnographic studies of breast cancer screening and cancer treatment planning in multidisciplinary team meetings to show how participants made themselves accountable both to each other and to the organisations of which they are members. We use these findings to enrich existing understandings of the requirements for trustworthy AI and to outline some candidate solutions to the problems of making AI accountable both to individual users and organisationally. We conclude by outlining the implications of this for future work on the development of trustworthy AI, including ways in which our proposed solutions may be re-used in different application settings.},

This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. C4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies. This book should be of interest to developers of classification-based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses.},

The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pretraining objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new "Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus", we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our data set, pre-trained models, and code.},

  abstract = {In Industry 4.0, manufacturing entails a rapid change in customer demands which leads to mass customization. The variation in customer requirements leads to small batch sizes and several process variations. Assembly task is one of most important steps in any manufacturing process. A factory floor worker often needs a guidance system due to variations in product or process, to assist them in assembly task. Existing Augmented Reality (AR) based systems use markers for each assembly component for detection which is time consuming and laborious. This paper proposed utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning based object detection technique and employed a regression based mapping technique to obtain the 3D locations of assembly components. Automatic detection of machine parts was followed by a multimodal interface involving both eye gaze and hand tracking to guide the manual assembly process. We proposed eye cursor to guide the user through the task and utilized fingertip distances along with object sizes to detect any error committed during the task. We analyzed the proposed mapping method and found that the mean mapping error was 1.842~cm. We also investigated the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal user interface by conducting two user studies. The first study indicated that the current interface design with eye cursor enabled participants to perform the task significantly faster compared to the interface without eye cursor. The shop floor workers during the second user study reported that the proposed guidance system was comprehendible and easy to use to complete the assembly task. Results showed that the proposed guidance system enabled 11 end users to finish the assembly of one pneumatic cylinder within 55~s with average TLX score less than 25 in a scale of 100 and Cronbach alpha score of 0.8 indicating convergence of learning experience.},

The work aimed to highlight the opportunities that bring new business models based on AI/ML to improve processes in traditional industries. Methodologically, bibliographic research in the Scopus database was performed to establish the conceptual framework and the state of the art in the steel industry, then the case was presented and analyzed, to finally evaluate the impact of the new business model on the operation of the steel mill. The results of the case highlighted the way the innovative business model, based on a No-Code/Low-Code solution, achieved results in less time than conventional approaches of analytics solutions, and the way it is possible to democratize artificial intelligence and machine learning in traditional industrial environments. This work was focused on opportunities that arise around new business models linked to AI. In addition, the study looked into the framework of the adoption of AI/ML in a traditional industrial environment toward a smart manufacturing approach. The contribution of this article was the proposal of an innovative methodology to put AI/ML in the hands of process operators. It aimed to show how it was possible to achieve better results in a less complex and time-consuming adoption process.

  abstract = {Natural language generation (NLG) systems are computer software    systems that produce texts in English and other human languages, often    from non-linguistic input data. NLG systems, like most AI systems, need    substantial amounts of knowledge.  However, our experience in two     NLG projects suggests that it is difficult to acquire correct knowledge     for NLG systems; indeed, every knowledge acquisition (KA) technique     we tried had significant problems. In general terms, these problems were     due to the complexity, novelty, and poorly understood nature of the     tasks our systems attempted, and were worsened by the fact that people    write so differently. This meant in particular that corpus-based KA     approaches suffered because it was impossible to assemble a sizable     corpus of high-quality consistent manually written texts in our domains;    and structured expert-oriented KA techniques suffered because experts     disagreed and because we could not get enough information about special     and unusual cases to build robust systems. We believe that such problems     are likely to affect many other NLG systems as well.  In the long term,     we hope that new KA techniques may emerge to help NLG system builders.      In the shorter term, we believe that understanding how individual KA     techniques can fail, and using a mixture of different KA techniques     with different strengths and weaknesses, can help developers acquire     NLG knowledge that is mostly correct.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cortical amyloid quantification on PET by using the standardized uptake value ratio is valuable for research studies and clinical trials in Alzheimer disease. However, it is resource intensive, requiring co-registered MR imaging data and specialized segmentation software. We investigated the use of deep learning to automatically quantify standardized uptake value ratio and used this for classification.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, we identified 2582 18F-florbetapir PET scans, which were separated into positive and negative cases by using a standardized uptake value ratio threshold of 1.1. We trained convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50 and ResNet-152) to predict standardized uptake value ratio and classify amyloid status. We assessed performance based on network depth, number of PET input slices, and use of ImageNet pretraining. We also assessed human performance with 3 readers in a subset of 100 randomly selected cases.RESULTS: We have found that 48 \% of cases were amyloid positive. The best performance was seen for ResNet-50 by using regression before classification, 3 input PET slices, and pretraining, with a standardized uptake value ratio root-mean-square error of 0.054, corresponding to 95.1 \% correct amyloid status prediction.

  abstract = {The use of text-based chatbots offering individual support to customers has increased steadily in recent years. However, thus far, research has focused on comparing text-based chatbots with either each other or with humans, whilst the investigation of task-based dialogues has been scarce. This paper aims to identify the characteristics of dialogues -- that is, conversational elements -- that lead to a successful task-based conversation. For this purpose, the chatbot, KIM, by MAGGI Kochstudio was used. It was designed to help customers find a recipe tailored to their individual needs. In order to investigate which conversational elements contribute to successful communication between the user and the chatbot KIM, a usability study collecting 123 unstructured dialogues and a scenario-based experiment using four dialogues with 627 respondents was conducted. The quantitative analysis demonstrates that task completion is characterized by a higher perception of the chatbot's conversational ability and user satisfaction. The chatbot should propose correct recipe suggestions following a short dialogue, without the user needing to provide too much input. Based on these findings, we recommended equipping the skillset of task-based chatbots with elements that will complement their assistive qualities -- for example, improved use of standard phrases, and reactions to similar domains and non-requests. Gender-specific differences in task completion should be considered.},

We conducted 15 focus groups examining patient views of diverse applications of AI in healthcare. Our results indicate that patients have multiple concerns, including concerns related to the safety of AI, threats to patient choice, potential increases in healthcare costs, data-source bias, and data security. We also found that patient acceptance of AI is contingent on mitigating these possible harms. Our results highlight an array of patient concerns that may limit enthusiasm for applications of AI in healthcare. Proactively addressing these concerns is critical for the flourishing of ethical innovation and ensuring the long-term success of AI applications in healthcare.},

Recently, squeeze and excitation (SE) modules and variations thereof have been introduced to recalibrate feature maps channel- and spatial-wise, which can boost performance while only minimally increasing model complexity. So far, the development of SE has focused on 2D images. In this paper, we propose `Project \& Excite' (PE) modules that base upon the ideas of SE and extend them to operating on 3D volumetric images. `Project \& Excite' does not perform global average pooling, but squeezes feature maps along different slices of a tensor separately to retain more spatial information that is subsequently used in the excitation step. We demonstrate that PE modules can be easily integrated in 3D U-Net, boosting performance by \$\$5{\textbackslash}\%\$\$5\%Dice points, while only increasing the model complexity by \$\$2{\textbackslash}\%\$\$2\%. We evaluate the PE module on two challenging tasks, whole-brain segmentation of MRI scans and whole-body segmentation of CT scans. Code: https://github.com/ai-med/squeeze\_and\_excitation.},

Adaptivity concerns both the content being proposed, the sequence of learning items, and the way the conversation is conducted. The original approach allows the development of sustainable chatbots and empowers various non-technical actors (authors, teachers, publishers, and learners) to control the chatbot features directly. The aCHAT-WF framework (adaptive CHATbot for WorkFlows), proposed in this paper for managing conversational interfaces, conceptually represents all the aspects related to a conversation about business processes, with different facets for the user, the conversation flow, and the conversation contents, combining them to obtain a flexible interaction with the user. The paper focuses on the different preparation phases for instructional material based on Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) models, separating the different roles involved in the construction of a chatbot for teaching business processes and with the possibility of defining different styles for the interaction with the users. The proposed method is configuration-driven, to facilitate the separation of the different aspects of the control of the interaction and the delivery of contents.},

Some people hope that creating methods for explaining these black box models will alleviate some of the problems, but trying to explain black box models, rather than creating models that are interpretable in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practice and can potentially cause great harm to society. The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.},

Conflict between humans and machines is seen as inevitable and its outcome all too predictable.In this groundbreaking book, distinguished AI researcher Stuart Russell argues that this scenario can be avoided, but only if we rethink AI from the ground up. Russell begins by exploring the idea of intelligence in humans and in machines. He describes the near-term benefits we can expect, from intelligent personal assistants to vastly accelerated scientific research, and outlines the AI breakthroughs that still have to happen before we reach superhuman AI. He also spells out the ways humans are already finding to misuse AI, from lethal autonomous weapons to viral sabotage.If the predicted breakthroughs occur and superhuman AI emerges, we will have created entities far more powerful than ourselves. How can we ensure they never, ever, have power over us? Russell suggests that we can rebuild AI on a new foundation, according to which machines are designed to be inherently uncertain about the human preferences they are required to satisfy. Such machines would be humble, altruistic, and committed to pursue our objectives, not theirs. This new foundation would allow us to create machines that are provably deferential and provably beneficial.},

Compared to text-based interaction, speech is natural and intuitive, which is why companies use VAs in customer service. However, we do not yet know for which kinds of tasks speech is beneficial. Drawing on task-technology fit theory, we present a research model to examine the applicability of VAs to different tasks. To test this model, we conducted a laboratory experiment with 116 participants who had to complete an information search task with a VA or a chatbot. The results show that speech exhibits higher perceived efficiency, lower cognitive effort, higher enjoyment, and higher service satisfaction than text-based interaction. We also find that these effects depend on the task's goal-directedness. These findings extend task-technology fit theory to customers'choice of interaction modalities and inform practitioners about the use of VAs for information search tasks.},

  abstract = {Interaction plays a vital role during visual network exploration as users need to engage with both elements in the view (e.g., nodes, links) and interface controls (e.g., sliders, dropdown menus). Particularly as the size and complexity of a network grow, interactive displays supporting multimodal input (e.g., touch, speech, pen, gaze) exhibit the potential to facilitate fluid interaction during visual network exploration and analysis. While multimodal interaction with network visualization seems like a promising idea, many open questions remain. For instance, do users actually prefer multimodal input over unimodal input, and if so, why? Does it enable them to interact more naturally, or does having multiple modes of input confuse users? To answer such questions, we conducted a qualitative user study in the context of a network visualization tool, comparing speech- and touch-based unimodal interfaces to a multimodal interface combining the two. Our results confirm that participants strongly prefer multimodal input over unimodal input attributing their preference to: 1) the freedom of expression, 2) the complementary nature of speech and touch, and 3) integrated interactions afforded by the combination of the two modalities. We also describe the interaction patterns participants employed to perform common network visualization operations and highlight themes for future multimodal network visualization systems to consider.},

To address this issue, this article presents MATERIALIST, a methodological and technological framework that supports stakeholders involved in a software development lifecycle in including GDPR in their activities. Specifically, it provides design patterns that can be selected starting from GDPR articles, code vulnerabilities, and software lifecycle phases. The framework aims to facilitate the adoption of appropriate privacy implementation mechanisms in the software development lifecycle, thereby improving software quality.},

  abstract = {information on certain topics. Applying a well-structured and machine-readable format for a knowledge base is a prerequisite for any AI-based processing or reasoning. Semantic technologies (e.g. RDF) offer such a format and have the advantages that they make it possible to define the semantics of the information and support advanced querying. However, the disadvantage is that using such technologies is challenging for people not trained in IT, such as subject matter experts. This means that they need to rely on semantic technology experts to create, maintain, and query their knowledge bases. However, these experts are, in turn, not trained in the subject matter, while domain knowledge is essential for the construction of high-quality knowledge bases. In this paper, we present an end-user engineering approach for ontology-based knowledge bases. The goal is to allow subject matter experts to develop, maintain, and exploit the knowledge base themselves. We also present the supporting tools developed so far. The tools for the construction and the manual filling of the knowledge base are using the jigsaw metaphor to hide technicalities and guide the users. We also developed tools to automatically import data from spreadsheets into the knowledge base and to perform some type of quality control on the data. The end-user approach and the tools are demonstrated and evaluated for building a knowledge base in the toxicology domain.},

In 1981 he proposed a formal model to extend the original idea about the role of the stimulus evaluation factors in differentiating emotional states to a sequence model. This model states that the differentiated emotional states are the result of the successive outcomes of a series of stimulus evaluation checks. A CPM of emotion was then developed. The CPM postulates 5 functionally defined subsystems of an organism that are centrally involved in the emotional process: information processing, support, executive, action, and monitoring. Differences between this theory and discrete emotion theory are discussed, and the CPM is used to account for the semantic structure of natural language emotion terms. Two studies, involving 10 Ss who sorted emotion terms and 636 students who completed a questionnaire on situations that provoke emotional arousal, are cited, and results concerning antecedents and reactions are noted.

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become the buzzword of the last decade. Advances so far have been largely technical with a focus on machine learning (ML). Only recently have we begun seeing a shift towards focusing on the human aspects of artificial intelligence, centered on the narrow view of making AI interactive and explainable. In this paper I suggest a definition for "Interactive Human Centered Artificial Intelligence and outline the required properties. Staying in control is essential for humans to feel safe and have self-determination. Hence, we need to find ways for humans to understand AI based systems and means to allow human control and oversight. In our work, we argue that levels of abstractions and granularity of control are a general solution to this. Furthermore, it is essential that we make explicit why we want AI and what are the goals of AI research and development. We need to state the properties that we expect of future intelligent systems and who will benefit from a system or service. For me, AI and ML are very much comparable to raw materials (like stone, iron, or bronze). Historical periods are named after these materials as they fundamentally changed what humans can build and what tools humans can engineer. Hence, I argue that in the AI age we need to shift the focus from the material (e.g. the AI algorithms, as there will be plenty of material) towards the tools and infrastructures that are enabled which are beneficial to humans. It is apparent that AI will allow the automation of mental routine tasks and that it will extend our ability to perceive the world and foresee events. For me, the central question is how to create these tools for amplifying the human mind without compromising human values.},

However, the application of such tools in usability engineering (UE) for measuring the emotional state of participants is rarely employed. We investigate if the application of sentiment/emotion recognition software is beneficial for gathering objective and intuitive data that can predict usability similar to traditional usability metrics. We present the results of a UE project examining this question for the three modalities text, speech and face. We perform a large scale usability test (N = 125) with a counterbalanced within-subject design with two websites of varying usability. We have identified a weak but significant correlation between text-based sentiment analysis on the text acquired via thinking aloud and SUS scores as well as a weak positive correlation between the proportion of neutrality in users' voice and SUS scores. However, for the majority of the output of emotion recognition software, we could not find any significant results. Emotion metrics could not be used to successfully differentiate between two websites of varying usability. Regression models, either unimodal or multimodal could not predict usability metrics. We discuss reasons for these results and how to continue research with more sophisticated methods.},

What connects these various types of intelligent agents is their ability to interact with people through voice. Voice is becoming an essential modality of embodiment, communication, and interaction between computer-based agents and end-users. This survey presents a meta-synthesis on agent voice in the design and experience of agents from a human-centered perspective: voice-based human--agent interaction (vHAI). Findings emphasize the social role of voice in HAI as well as circumscribe a relationship between agent voice and body, corresponding to human models of social psychology and cognition. Additionally, changes in perceptions of and reactions to agent voice over time reveals a generational shift coinciding with the commercial proliferation of mobile voice assistants. The main contributions of this work are a vHAI classification framework for voice across various agent forms, contexts, and user groups, a critical analysis grounded in key theories, and an identification of future directions for the oncoming wave of vocal machines.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing number of cyber-systems (e.g., payment, transportation, voting, critical-infrastructure systems) whose security depends intrinsically on human users. A security ceremony expands a security protocol with everything that is considered out-of-band to it, including, in particular, the mistakes that human users might make when participating actively in the security ceremony. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for the formal analysis of security ceremonies. Our approach defines mutation rules that model possible behaviors of a human user, and automatically generates mutations in the behavior of the other agents of the ceremony to match the human-induced mutations. This allows for the analysis of the original ceremony specification and its possible mutations, which may include the way in which the ceremony has actually been implemented. To automate our approach, we have developed the tool X-Men, which is a prototype that extends Tamarin, one of the most common tools for the automatic unbounded verification of security protocols. As a proof of concept, we have applied our approach to two real-life case studies, uncovering a number of concrete vulnerabilities.},

In virtual commerce, the alignment of application design paradigms and the factors influencing consumer behavior is paramount to promote purchase of products and services. The question of their relation needs to be answered, together with the possible improvement of application design. This paper used a systematic literature review approach to synthesize research on virtual commerce from both application design and consumer behavior research, considering the promotion of purchase in virtual commerce settings. Throughout the review, influential factors to purchase and preeminent design artifacts were identified. Then, the research gaps were discovered by mapping the design artifacts to the influential factors, which can inspire future research opportunities on the synergy of these two research directions. Moreover, the evolution of virtual commerce research along with multiple directions were discussed, including the suggestion of meta-commerce as a future trend.},

  abstract = {Advances in both imaging and computers have led to the rise in the potential use of artificial intelligence (AI) in various tasks in breast imaging, going beyond the current use in computer-aided detection to include diagnosis, prognosis, response to therapy, and risk assessment. The automated capabilities of AI offer the potential to enhance the diagnostic expertise of clinicians, including accurate demarcation of tumor volume, extraction of characteristic cancer phenotypes, translation of tumoral phenotype features to clinical genotype implications, and risk prediction. The combination of image-specific findings with the underlying genomic, pathologic, and clinical features is becoming of increasing value in breast cancer. The concurrent emergence of newer imaging techniques has provided radiologists with greater diagnostic tools and image datasets to analyze and interpret. Integrating an AI-based workflow within breast imaging enables the integration of multiple data streams into powerful multidisciplinary applications that may lead the path to personalized patient-specific medicine. In this article we describe the goals of AI in breast cancer imaging, in particular MRI, and review the literature as it relates to the current application, potential, and limitations in breast cancer.

  abstract = {The emerging field of eXplainable AI (XAI) in the medical domain is considered to be of utmost importance. Meanwhile, incorporating explanations in the medical domain with respect to legal and ethical AI is necessary to understand detailed decisions, results, and current status of the patient's conditions. Successively, we will be presenting a detailed survey for the medical XAI with the model enhancements, evaluation methods, significant overview of case studies with open box architecture, medical open datasets, and future improvements. Potential differences in AI and XAI methods are provided with the recent XAI methods stated as (i) local and global methods for preprocessing, (ii) knowledge base and distillation algorithms, and (iii) interpretable machine learning. XAI characteristics details with future healthcare explainability is included prominently, whereas the pre-requisite provides insights for the brainstorming sessions before beginning a medical XAI project. Practical case study determines the recent XAI progress leading to the advance developments within the medical field. Ultimately, this survey proposes critical ideas surrounding a user-in-the-loop approach, with an emphasis on human--machine collaboration, to better produce explainable solutions. The surrounding details of the XAI feedback system for human rating-based evaluation provides intelligible insights into a constructive method to produce human enforced explanation feedback. For a long time, XAI limitations of the ratings, scores and grading are present. Therefore, a novel XAI recommendation system and XAI scoring system are designed and approached from this work. Additionally, this paper encourages the importance of implementing explainable solutions into the high impact medical field.},

These human aspirations also encourage consideration of privacy, security, environmental protection, social justice, and human rights. This commentary reverses the current emphasis on algorithms and AI methods, by putting humans at the center of systems design thinking, in effect, a second Copernican Revolution. It offers three ideas: (1) a two-dimensional HCAI framework, which shows how it is possible to have both high levels of human control AND high levels of automation, (2) a shift from emulating humans to empowering people with a plea to shift language, imagery, and metaphors away from portrayals of intelligent autonomous teammates towards descriptions of powerful tool-like appliances and tele-operated devices, and (3) a three-level governance structure that describes how software engineering teams can develop more reliable systems, how managers can emphasize a safety culture across an organization, and how industry-wide certification can promote trustworthy HCAI systems. These ideas will be challenged by some, refined by others, extended to accommodate new technologies, and validated with quantitative and qualitative research. They offer a reframe -- a chance to restart design discussions for products and services -- which could bring greater benefits to individuals, families, communities, businesses, and society.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has the potential to improve patient outcomes, but clinician acceptance remains a critical barrier. We developed a novel decision support interface that provides interpretable treatment recommendations for sepsis, a life-threatening condition in which decisional uncertainty is common, treatment practices vary widely, and poor outcomes can occur even with optimal decisions. This system formed the basis of a mixed-methods study in which 24 intensive care clinicians made AI-assisted decisions on real patient cases. We found that explanations generally increased confidence in the AI, but concordance with specific recommendations varied beyond the binary acceptance or rejection described in prior work. Although clinicians sometimes ignored or trusted the AI, they also often prioritized aspects of the recommendations to follow, reject, or delay in a process we term ``negotiation.'' These results reveal novel barriers to adoption of treatment-focused AI tools and suggest ways to better support differing clinician perspectives.},

  abstract = {Since its inception, computer aided 3D modeling has primarily relied on the Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer (WIMP) interface in which user input is in the form of keystrokes and pointer movements. The brain--computer interface (BCI) is a novel modality that uses the brain signals of a user to enable natural and intuitive interaction with an external device. In this paper we present a human factors study on the use of an Emotiv EEG BCI headset for 3D CAD modeling. The study focuses on substituting the conventional computer mouse- and keyboard-based inputs with inputs from the Emotiv EEG headset. The main steps include (1) training the headset to recognize user-specific EEG/EMG signals and (2) assigning the classified signals to emulate keystrokes which are used to activate/control different commands of a CAD package. To assess the performance of the new system, we compared the time taken by the users to create the 3D CAD models using both the conventional and BCI-based interfaces. In addition, to exhibit the adaptability of the new system, we carried out the study for a set of CAD models of varying complexity.},

  abstract = {Algorithms have evolved from machine code to low-code-no-code (LCNC) in the past 20 years. Observing the growth of LCNC-based algorithm development, the CEO of GitHub mentioned that the future of coding is no coding at all. This paper systematically reviewed several of the recent studies using mainstream LCNC platforms to understand the area of research, the LCNC platforms used within these studies, and the features of LCNC used for solving individual research questions. We identified 23 research works using LCNC platforms, such as SetXRM, the vf-OS platform, Aure-BPM, CRISP-DM, and Microsoft Power Platform (MPP). About 61\% of these existing studies resorted to MPP as their primary choice. The critical research problems solved by these research works were within the area of global news analysis, social media analysis, landslides, tornadoes, COVID-19, digitization of process, manufacturing, logistics, and software/app development. The main reasons identified for solving research problems with LCNC algorithms were as follows: (1) obtaining research data from multiple sources in complete automation; (2) generating artificial intelligence-driven insights without having to manually code them. In the course of describing this review, this paper also demonstrates a practical approach to implement a cyber-attack monitoring algorithm with the most popular LCNC platform.},

Going forth, reconciling such tensions between machine agency and human agency will be important in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), as machines get more agentic and media experiences become increasingly determined by algorithms. Theory and research should be geared toward a deeper understanding of the human experience of algorithms in general and the psychology of Human--AI interaction (HAII) in particular. This article proposes some directions by applying the dual-process framework of the Theory of Interactive Media Effects (TIME) for studying the symbolic and enabling effects of the affordances of AI-driven media on user perceptions and experiences.},

In this paper, we eschew prior expertise- and role-based categorizations of interpretability stakeholders in favor of a more granular framework that decouples stakeholders' knowledge from their interpretability needs. We characterize stakeholders by their formal, instrumental, and personal knowledge and how it manifests in the contexts of machine learning, the data domain, and the general milieu. We additionally distill a hierarchical typology of stakeholder needs that distinguishes higher-level domain goals from lower-level interpretability tasks. In assessing the descriptive, evaluative, and generative powers of our framework, we find our more nuanced treatment of stakeholders reveals gaps and opportunities in the interpretability literature, adds precision to the design and comparison of user studies, and facilitates a more reflexive approach to conducting this research.},

While the issue of what enables MC has been intensively researched, investigation of several questions is still required, such as which enablers should be implemented and in what sequence, depending on the specific context in which MC is pursued. Other areas for future study of MC-IGs include applicability context specifications, as-is analysis tools, hindrance factors and required resources. This article complements previous MC literature reviews by providing an overview of MC-IGs available in the literature, identifying the building blocks of MC-IGs and proposing a definition of MC-IGs that can be used as a basis for future research in MC implementation.},

  abstract = {Gestures are an important medium of human communication and have been studied throughout the centuries from different viewpoints and in different domains ranging from arts, linguistics, philosophy and engineering. Recent developments in gestures based human-computer interaction (HCI) studies are noteworthy. However, commercial application of hand gestures in computer aided sketching and modeling is rarely found. The present study focuses on identifying various aspects of hand gestures that can be used as an input to a gesture based CAD software for sketching and 3D modeling tasks. First, we experimentally observed and studied hand gestures performed by users to convey CAD sketch and 3D modeling commands. Next, we performed literature study to compile a repository of gestures used by researchers in conveying various commands for gesture based human computer interaction. With the knowledge gleaned from these two steps a simplified yet representative taxonomy was created to classify hand gestures which can be used for drawing tasks in CAD. During the course of these studies we identified various attributes/requirements of a gesture based CAD software, consideration of which will help in enhancing the CAD designer experience.},

  abstract = {In the past, research on human--technology interaction has almost exclusively concentrated on aspects of usefulness and usability. Despite the success of this line of research, its narrow perspective has recently become a target for criticism. To explain why people prefer some systems over others, factors such as aesthetic qualities and emotional experiences play an important role in addition to instrumental aspects. In the following, we report three experiments that illustrate the importance of such factors. In the first experiment, we study the role of emotions in human--technology interaction by using Scherer's (                              1984) component theory of emotions as a theoretical foundation. A combination of methods is derived from that theory and employed to measure subjective feelings, motor expressions, physiological reactions, cognitive appraisals, and behaviour. The results demonstrate that the manipulation of selected system properties may lead to differences in usability that affect emotional user reactions. The second experiment investigates the interplay of instrumental and non-instrumental system qualities. The results show that users' overall appraisal of a technical device is influenced by both groups of qualities. In the third experiment, we join the approaches of the first two studies to analyse the influence of usability and aesthetics within a common design. The results indicate that systems differing in these aspects affect the perception of instrumental and non-instrumental qualities as well as the users' emotional experience and their overall appraisal of the system. Summarizing our results, we present a model specifying three central               c               omponents of               u               ser               e               xperience and their interrelations (CUE-Model). The model integrates the most important aspects of human--technology interaction and hints at a number of interesting issues for future research.                        ,                             Dans le pass{\'e}, la recherche sur l'interaction entre l'humain et la technologie s'est presque exclusivement concentr{\'e}e sur les aspects d'emploi et d'utilit{\'e}. Malgr{\'e} son succ{\`e}s, ce champ de recherche pr{\'e}sente une perspective {\'e}troite qui est devenue r{\'e}cemment l'objet de critique. En plus des aspects instrumentaux, des facteurs comme les qualit{\'e}s esth{\'e}tiques et les exp{\'e}riences {\'e}motives jouent un r{\^o}le important pour expliquer pourquoi les gens pr{\'e}f{\`e}rent certains syst{\`e}mes mieux que d'autres. Dans ce qui suit, nous rapportons trois exp{\'e}rimentations qui illustrent l'importance de ces facteurs. Dans la premi{\`e}re exp{\'e}rimentation, nous {\'e}tudions le r{\^o}le des {\'e}motions dans l'interaction entre l'humain et la technologie en utilisant le mod{\`e}le composant des {\'e}motions de Scherer (                              1984) comme cadre th{\'e}orique. Une combinaison de m{\'e}thodes est d{\'e}riv{\'e}e de ce mod{\`e}le th{\'e}orique et utilis{\'e}e pour mesurer les sentiments subjectifs,~les expressions motrices, les r{\'e}actions physiologiques, les {\'e}valuations cognitives, et le comportement. Les r{\'e}sultats d{\'e}montrent que la manipulation des propri{\'e}t{\'e}s du syst{\`e}me qui ont {\'e}t{\'e} choisies peut causer des diff{\'e}rences dans l'emploi qui affecte les r{\'e}actions {\'e}motives de l'usager. La deuxi{\`e}me exp{\'e}rimentation examine l'interaction entre les qualit{\'e}s instrumentales et non instrumentales du syst{\`e}me. Les r{\'e}sultats indiquent que l'{\'e}valuation globale des usagers d'un appareil technique est influenc{\'e}e {\`a} la fois par les deux groupes de qualit{\'e}s. Dans la troisi{\`e}me exp{\'e}rimentation, nous combinons les approches des deux premi{\`e}res {\'e}tudes afin d'analyser l'influence de l'utilit{\'e} et de l'esth{\'e}tique au sein d'un design commun. Les r{\'e}sultats indiquent que les syst{\`e}mes qui diff{\`e}rent par ces aspects affectent la perception des qualit{\'e}s instrumentales et non instrumentales ainsi que l'exp{\'e}rience {\'e}motive des usagers et leur {\'e}valuation globale du syst{\`e}me. Pour r{\'e}sumer nos r{\'e}sultats, nous pr{\'e}sentons un mod{\`e}le qui sp{\'e}cifie trois composantes centrales de l'               e               xp{\'e}rience de l'               u               sager et leurs interrelations (Le mod{\`e}le CEU ou CUE-Model en anglais). Le mod{\`e}le int{\`e}gre les aspects les plus importants de l'interaction entre l'humain et la technologie et sugg{\`e}re quelques sujets int{\'e}ressants pour la recherche future.                        ,                             En el pasado, los estudios de la interacci{\'o}n humano--tecnolog{\'i}a se centraban casi exclusivamente en el aspecto de utilidad y usabilidad. A pesar de los logros de esta l{\'i}nea de investigaci{\'o}n {\'u}ltimamente se ha criticado su estrecha perspectiva. Para explicar el por qu{\'e} las personas prefieren unos sistemas sobre otros hay que tener en cuenta factores como cualidades est{\'e}ticas y la experiencia emocional, la cual juega un rol importante a parte de los aspectos instrumentales. En este estudio se presenta tres experimentos, los cuales reflejan la importancia de estos factores. En el primero de ellos se estudia el rol de las emociones en la interacci{\'o}n humano--tecnolog{\'i}a utilizando como base la teor{\'i}a de componentes de las emociones de Scherer (                              1984). De esta teor{\'i}a se deriva una combinaci{\'o}n de m{\'e}todos empleados para medir los sentimientos subjetivos, expresiones motoras, reacciones fisiol{\'o}gicas, valoraciones cognitivas y comportamiento. Los resultados demuestran que la manipulaci{\'o}n de unas propiedades selectivas del sistema puede conducir a diferencias en usabilidad, lo cual afecta las reacciones emocionales del usuario. El segundo experimento estudia la interacci{\'o}n entre las cualidades instrumentales y no instrumentales del sistema. Los resultados demuestran que las valoraciones totales de los dispositivos t{\'e}cnicos son influidas por ambos grupos de cualidades. En el tercer experimento hemos juntado las aproximaciones de los dos primeros estudios para analizar la influencia de la usabilidad y est{\'e}tica dentro de un dise{\~n}o com{\'u}n. Los resultados indican que los sistemas que difieren en estos aspectos afectan la percepci{\'o}n de las cualidades instrumentales y no instrumentales junto con la experiencia emocional del usuario y la valoraci{\'o}n total del sistema. Resumiendo nuestros resultados, presentamos un modelo especificando tres componentes centrales de la experiencia del usuario y sus interrelaciones (el modelo CUE). El modelo integra los aspectos m{\'a}s importantes de la interacci{\'o}n humano--tecnolog{\'i}a y se{\~n}ala numerosas e interesantes investigaciones para el futuro.},

  abstract = {In this paper we consider how to help users to better understand their consumption profiles by examining two approaches to visualising user profiles - chord diagrams, and bar charts - aimed at revealing to users those regions of the recommendation space that are unknown to them, i.e. blind-spots. Both visualisations do this by connecting profile preferences with a filtered recommendation space. We compare and contrast the two visualisations in a live user study (n = 70). The results suggest that, although users can understand both visualisations, chord diagrams are particularly effective in helping users to identify blind-spots, while simpler bar charts are better for conveying what was already known in a profile. Evaluating the understandability of blind-spot visualizations is a first step toward using visual explanations to help address a criticism of recommender systems: that personalising information creates filter bubbles.},

  abstract = {Personalized news experiences powered by recommender systems permeate our lives and have the potential to influence not only our opinions, but also our decisions. At the same time, the content and viewpoints contained within news recommendations are driven by multiple factors, including both personalization and editorial selection. Explanations could help users gain a better understanding of the factors contributing to the news items selected for them to read. Indeed, recent works show that explanations are essential for users of news recommenders to understand their consumption preferences and set intentions in line with their goals, such as goals for knowledge development and increased diversity of content or viewpoints. We give examples of such works on explanation and interactive interface interventions which have been effective in influencing readers' consumption intentions and behaviors in news recommendations. However, the state-of-the-art in news recommender systems currently fall short in terms of evaluating such interventions in live systems, limiting our ability to measure their true impact on user behavior and opinions. To help understand the true benefit of these interfaces, we therefore call for improving the realism of studies for news.},

  abstract = {As algorithmic (and particularly machine learning) decision making systems become both more widespread and make more important decisions, there are growing concerns about their embedded values and ability to establish legitimacy among decision subjects. We argue that designing for contestability in these systems can assist in surfacing values, aligning system design and use with context, and building legitimacy. However, designing for contestability can be challenging, particularly in systems that are designed to be opaque: systems need to accurately surface embedded values, expose decision making processes in ways that are meaningful for users, support engagement with and allow influence over system performance, and so on. In addition to these technical aspects, designing for contestability may by challenged by the need to protect intellectual property and prevent gaming of the system. In this workshop, we will address goals, audiences, and designs for contestability in algorithmic systems. We hope to develop a taxonomy of contestable systems and understand the value provided by contestability, while bringing together a community to work on this multidisciplinary problem.},

  abstract = {The emergence of big data combined with the technical developments in Artificial Intelligence has enabled novel opportunities for autonomous and continuous decision support. While initial work has begun to explore how human morality can inform the decision making of future Artificial Intelligence applications, these approaches typically consider human morals as static and immutable. In this work, we present an initial exploration of the effect of context on human morality from a Utilitarian perspective. Through an online narrative transportation study, in which participants are primed with either a positive story, a negative story or a control condition (N\,=\,82), we collect participants' perceptions on technology that has to deal with moral judgment in changing contexts. Based on an in-depth qualitative analysis of participant responses, we contrast participant perceptions to related work on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency. Our work highlights the importance of contextual morality for Artificial Intelligence and identifies opportunities for future work through a FACT-based (Fairness, Accountability, Context and Transparency) perspective.},

  abstract = {To help researchers conduct a systematic review or meta-analysis as efficiently and transparently as possible, we designed a tool to accelerate the step of screening titles and abstracts. For many tasks---including but not limited to systematic reviews and meta-analyses---the scientific literature needs to be checked systematically. Scholars and practitioners currently screen thousands of studies by hand to determine which studies to include in their review or meta-analysis. This is error prone and inefficient because of extremely imbalanced data: only a fraction of the screened studies is relevant. The future of systematic reviewing will be an interaction with machine learning algorithms to deal with the enormous increase of available text. We therefore developed an open source machine learning-aided pipeline applying active learning: ASReview. We demonstrate by means of simulation studies that active learning can yield far more efficient reviewing than manual reviewing while providing high quality. Furthermore, we describe the options of the free and open source research software and present the results from user experience tests. We invite the community to contribute to open source projects such as our own that provide measurable and reproducible improvements over current practice.},

  abstract = {Central nervous system tumours represent one of the most lethal cancer types, particularly among children1. Primary treatment includes neurosurgical resection of the tumour, in which a delicate balance must be struck between maximizing the extent of resection and minimizing risk of neurological damage and comorbidity2,3. However, surgeons have limited knowledge of the precise tumour type prior to surgery. Current standard practice relies on preoperative imaging and intraoperative histological analysis, but these are not always conclusive and occasionally wrong. Using rapid nanopore sequencing, a sparse methylation profile can be obtained during surgery4. Here we developed Sturgeon, a patient-agnostic transfer-learned neural network, to enable molecular subclassification of central nervous system tumours based on such sparse profiles. Sturgeon delivered an accurate diagnosis within 40\,minutes after starting sequencing in 45 out of 50 retrospectively sequenced samples (abstaining from diagnosis of the other 5 samples). Furthermore, we demonstrated its applicability in real time during 25 surgeries, achieving a diagnostic turnaround time of less than 90\,min. Of these, 18 (72\%) diagnoses were correct and 7 did not reach the required confidence threshold. We conclude that machine-learned diagnosis based on low-cost intraoperative sequencing can assist neurosurgical decision-making, potentially preventing neurological comorbidity and avoiding additional surgeries.}

We analysed the dialogues with text analytics and qualitative analysis, including number of words and turns, social aspects of conversation, implied VA capabilities, and the influence of user personality. The majority envisioned dialogues with a VA that is interactive and not purely functional; it is smart, proactive, and has knowledge about the user. Attitudes diverged regarding the assistant's role as well as it expressing humour and opinions. An exploratory analysis suggested a relationship with personality for these aspects, but correlations were low overall. We discuss implications for research and design of future VAs, underlining the vision of enabling conversational UIs, rather than single command ``Q\&amp;As''.},

In a Wizard of Oz study, we found that, for the task of cooking a recipe, nearly one-quarter of all user-assistant exchanges were initiated from implicit conversational cues rather than from plain questions. Given that these implicit cues occur in such high frequency, we conclude by presenting a set of design implications for the design of guided task experiences in contemporary conversational assistants.},

  abstract = {Research into hand gestures for human computer interaction has been prolific recently, but within it research on hand gestures for conceptual design has either focused on gestures that were defined by the researchers rather than the users, or those that were heavily influenced by what can be achieved using currently available technology. This paper reports on the study performed to identify a user elicited vocabulary of gestures for conceptual design, disassociated from the currently available technology, and its subsequent evaluation. The study included 44 product design engineering students (3rd, 4th year and recent graduates) and identified 1772 gestures that were analysed to build a novel gesture consensus set of vocabulary of hand gestures for conceptual design. This set is then evaluated by 10 other professionals, in order to generalise this set for a wider range of users and possibly reduce the need for training. The evaluation has shown that majority of gestures added to the vocabulary were easy to perform and appropriate for the activities, but that at the implementation stage the vocabulary will require another round of evaluation to account for the technology capabilities. The aim of this work is to create a starting point for a potential future system that could adapt to individual designers and allow them to use non-prescribed gestures that will support rather than inhibit their conceptual design thinking processes, akin to the developments that happened in hand writing recognition or predictive texting.},

Our work stems from the knowledge gap that the fundamental principles necessary to operationalize speech as a viable means for describing and communicating 3D digital forms do not currently exist. To address this gap, we present a case study on 3D scene modeling within the context of interior design. For this, we implemented a constrained workflow wherein a user can iteratively generate variations of seed templates of objects in a scene through verbal input. Using this workflow as an experimental setup, we systematically study four aspects of speech-based shape exploration, namely, (a) design-in-context (creating one shape with respect or in relation to the other), (b) order independence (sequence of parts preferred in speech-based shape exploration), (c) multi-scale exploration (study how speech allows overview-then-detail modifications), and (d) semantic regions of interest (effectiveness of speech for modifying regions of a given object). We finally present an observational study with 6 participants selected from diverse backgrounds to better understand shape verbalization.},

  abstract = {A paradigm shift has been taking place in the personal computer sharing model: a computer is no longer shared by users, but shared by mutually distrusting applications or other content. This multi-application sharing model is mismatched with today's multi-user operating systems like Windows and Linux, which offer protection only across users. This mismatch contributes significantly to today's malware problem: a user is often tricked to download and install malware which runs with the privileges of the user or even with escalated privileges to harm the user's machine.Web-centric computing is another significant trend in computing, which makes web browsers a dominant client application platform. The browser platform supports a multi-application sharing model. However, today's web browsers have never been designed and constructed as an operating system: different web site principals may coexist in the same protection domain, and there is no coherent support for resource access, control, and sharing. This makes browsers a vulnerable and functionally limited platform.In the light of these two trends, we envision ServiceOS, a multi-service OS on which web applications and traditional desktop applications converge. "Service" comes from "Software-as-a-Service". A service is some generic content which can be either code or data. Services are hosted in the cloud and cached on the client. The owner of the service is an OS principal. ServiceOS will enable an application model that synthesizes the best elements from both desktop and web applications, providing fundamentally better security without sacrificing functionality. We sketch our design and present open challenges for this new paradigm of computing.},

  abstract = {From healthcare to criminal justice, artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly supporting high-consequence human decisions. This has spurred the field of explainable AI (XAI). This paper seeks to strengthen empirical application-specific investigations of XAI by exploring theoretical underpinnings of human decision making, drawing from the fields of philosophy and psychology. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for building human-centered, decision-theory-driven XAI based on an extensive review across these fields. Drawing on this framework, we identify pathways along which human cognitive patterns drives needs for building XAI and how XAI can mitigate common cognitive biases. We then put this framework into practice by designing and implementing an explainable clinical diagnostic tool for intensive care phenotyping and conducting a co-design exercise with clinicians. Thereafter, we draw insights into how this framework bridges algorithm-generated explanations and human decision-making theories. Finally, we discuss implications for XAI design and development.},

However, increasing importance has been argued for making AI more understandable to nonexperts, who are expected to leverage AI techniques, but have limited knowledge about AI. We present a mobile application to support nonexperts to interactively make sense of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); it allows users to play with a pre-trained CNN by taking pictures of their surrounding objects. We use an up-to-date XAI technique (Class Activation Map) to intuitively visualize the model's decision (the most important image regions that lead to a certain result). Deployed in a university course, this playful learning tool was found to support design students to gain vivid understandings about the capabilities and limitations of pre-trained CNNs in real-world environments. Concrete examples of students' playful explorations are reported to characterize their sensemaking processes reflecting different depths of thought.},

In this paper, We explore the potential to use social media content to identify individuals' cognitive styles. We first employed crowdsourcing to collect Twitter users' cognitive styles using standard psychometric instruments. Then, we extracted the linguistic features of their social media postings. Leveraging these features, we build prediction models that provide estimates of cognitive styles through statistical regression and classification. We find that user generated content in social media provide useful information for characterizing people's cognitive styles. The models' performance indicates that the cognitive styles automatically inferred from social media are good proxies for the ground truth, and hence provides a promising and scalable way to automatically identify a large number of people's cognitive styles without reaching them individually.},

  abstract = {To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent agent needs to incrementally acquire, update, accumulate, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. In a general sense, continual learning is explicitly limited by catastrophic forgetting, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance degradation of the old tasks. Beyond this, increasingly numerous advances have emerged in recent years that largely extend the understanding and application of continual learning. The growing and widespread interest in this direction demonstrates its realistic significance as well as complexity. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning, seeking to bridge the basic settings, theoretical foundations, representative methods, and practical applications. Based on existing theoretical and empirical results, we summarize the general objectives of continual learning as ensuring a proper stability-plasticity trade-off and an adequate intra/inter-task generalizability in the context of resource efficiency. Then we provide a state-of-the-art and elaborated taxonomy, extensively analyzing how representative strategies address continual learning, and how they are adapted to particular challenges in various applications. Through an in-depth discussion of promising directions, we believe that such a holistic perspective can greatly facilitate subsequent exploration in this field and beyond.},

There is no consensus on what the highest level of measurement is for trust. This is important as the level of measurement determines what mathematics and statistics can be meaningfully applied to ratings. In this work, we introduce a new method for determining what the maximum level of measurement is for psychometrically assessed phenomenon. We use this to determine the level of measurement of trust in automation using human ratings about the behaviour of unmanned aerial systems performing search tasks. Results show that trust is best represented at an ordinal level and that it can be treated as interval in most situations. It is unlikely that trust in automation can be considered ratio. We discuss these results, their implications, and future research.},

  abstract = {While the research area of artificial intelligence benefited from increasingly sophisticated machine learning techniques in recent years, the resulting systems suffer from a loss of transparency and comprehensibility, especially for end-users. In this paper, we explore the effects of incorporating virtual agents into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) designs on the perceived trust of end-users. For this purpose, we conducted a user study based on a simple speech recognition system for keyword classification. As a result of this experiment, we found that the integration of virtual agents leads to increased user trust in the XAI system. Furthermore, we found that the user's trust significantly depends on the modalities that are used within the user-agent interface design. The results of our study show a linear trend where the visual presence of an agent combined with a voice output resulted in greater trust than the output of text or the voice output alone. Additionally, we analysed the participants'feedback regarding the presented XAI visualisations. We found that increased human-likeness of and interaction with the virtual agent are the two most common mention points on how to improve the proposed XAI interaction design. Based on these results, we discuss current limitations and interesting topics for further research in the field of XAI. Moreover, we present design recommendations for virtual agents in XAI systems for future projects.},

Using a within-group comparison, we found no major differences between data collected by a usability engineer and that collected through an automated testing system for performance metrics. Using a between-group comparison, we found automated summative studies could be conducted remotely with minor but acceptable differences in time on task and likelihood to give up on a task compared to lab-based testing. Task success and task satisfaction ratings were not different between remote and lab-based summative testing. Written comments provided by participants through the testing system were sufficient to identify the major usability problems that led to task failure but did not reveal as comprehensive a set of issues as did a usability engineer observing the sessions.},

  abstract = {Chatbots or conversational recommenders have gained increasing popularity as a new paradigm for Recommender Systems (RS). Prior work on RS showed that providing explanations can improve transparency and trust, which are critical for the adoption of RS. Their interactive and engaging nature makes conversational recommenders a natural platform to not only provide recommendations but also justify the recommendations through explanations. The recent surge of interest inexplainable AI enables diverse styles of justification, and also invites questions on how styles of justification impact user perception. In this article, we explore the effect of ``why'' justifications and ``why not'' justifications on users' perceptions of explainability and trust. We developed and tested a movie-recommendation chatbot that provides users with different types of justifications for the recommended items. Our online experiment (n = 310) demonstrates that the ``why'' justifications (but not the ``why not'' justifications) have a significant impact on users' perception of the conversational recommender. Particularly, ``why'' justifications increase users' perception of system transparency, which impacts perceived control, trusting beliefs and in turn influences users' willingness to depend on the system's advice. Finally, we discuss the design implications for decision-assisting chatbots.},

  abstract = {Background: Systematic literature studies have become common in software engineering, and hence it is important to understand how to conduct them efficiently and reliably.Objective: This paper presents guidelines for conducting literature reviews using a snowballing approach, and they are illustrated and evaluated by replicating a published systematic literature review.Method: The guidelines are based on the experience from conducting several systematic literature reviews and experimenting with different approaches.Results: The guidelines for using snowballing as a way to search for relevant literature was successfully applied to a systematic literature review.Conclusions: It is concluded that using snowballing, as a first search strategy, may very well be a good alternative to the use of database searches.},

  abstract = {Trust is a key determinant of whether people rely on automated systems in the military and the public. However, there is currently no standard for measuring trust in automated systems. In the present studies, we propose a scale to measure trust in automated systems that is grounded in current research and theory on trust formation, which we refer to as the Trust in Automated Systems Test (TOAST). We evaluated both the reliability of the scale structure and criterion validity using independent, military-affiliated and civilian samples. In both studies we found that the TOAST exhibited a two-factor structure, measuring system understanding and performance (respectively), and that factor scores significantly predicted scores on theoretically related constructs demonstrating clear criterion validity. We discuss the implications of our findings for advancing the empirical literature and in improving interface design.},

  abstract = {This study presents a novel approach to automatic emotion recognition from text. First, emotion generation rules (EGRs) are manually deduced from psychology to represent the conditions for generating emotion. Based on the EGRs, the emotional state of each sentence can be represented as a sequence of semantic labels (SLs) and attributes (ATTs); SLs are defined as the domain-independent features, while ATTs are domain-dependent. The emotion association rules (EARs) represented by SLs and ATTs for each emotion are automatically derived from the sentences in an emotional text corpus using the a priori algorithm. Finally, a separable mixture model (SMM) is adopted to estimate the similarity between an input sentence and the EARs of each emotional state. Since some features defined in this approach are domain-dependent, a dialog system focusing on the students' daily expressions is constructed, and only three emotional states, happy, unhappy, and neutral, are considered for performance evaluation. According to the results of the experiments, given the domain corpus, the proposed approach is promising, and easily ported into other domains.},

  abstract = {When designing an AI-assisted decision-making system, there is often a tradeoff between precision and recall in the AI's recommendations. We argue that careful exploitation of this tradeoff can harness the complementary strengths in the human-AI collaboration to significantly improve team performance. We investigate a real-world video anonymization task for which recall is paramount and more costly to improve. We analyze the performance of 78 professional annotators working with a) no AI assistance, b) a high-precision "restrained" AI, and c) a high-recall "zealous" AI in over 3,466 person-hours of annotation work. In comparison, the zealous AI helps human teammates achieve significantly shorter task completion time and higher recall. In a follow-up study, we remove AI assistance for everyone and find negative training effects on annotators trained with the restrained AI. These findings and our analysis point to important implications for the design of AI assistance in recall-demanding scenarios.},

This study integrates mouse cursor motion analysis into affective computing and investigates the idea that movements of the computer cursor can provide information about emotion of the computer user. We extracted 16--26 trajectory features during a choice-reaching task and examined the link between emotion and cursor motions. Participants were induced for positive or negative emotions by music, film clips, or emotional pictures, and they indicated their emotions with questionnaires. Our 10-fold cross-validation analysis shows that statistical models formed from ``known'' participants (training data) could predict nearly 10 \%--20 \% of the variance of positive affect and attentiveness ratings of ``unknown'' participants, suggesting that cursor movement patterns such as the area under curve and direction change help infer emotions of computer users.},

The results show that each explanation improved users' trust in the classifier, and the combination of explanation, human, and classification algorithm yielded much better decisions than the human and classification algorithm separately.

This paper describes an exploratory study investigating the felt work experience and desired futures of professionals who use fabrication tools. We conducted co-design workshops with 23 professionals who use 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC routers. We probed about current practices; machine awareness and autonomy; and user agency. Our findings reveal that current tools are not very professional. They are unreliable and untrustworthy. Participants desired smarter tools that can actively prevent errors and perform self-calibration and self-maintenance. They had few concerns that more intelligence would impact agency. They desired tools that could negotiate trade-offs between time, cost, and quality; and that can operate as super-human shop assistants. We discuss the implications of these findings as opportunities for research that can improve professionals' work experience.},

Tracking the user's eye movement for Human-Computer Interaction in an augmented reality environment provides a convenient, natural, and highbandwidth source for navigating and zooming in/out of the 3D reconstructed object. The calculated 3D eye position, which is detected by multiple cues from a stereo camera, is synchronized with the 3D position of 3D reconstructed object. Our proposed method of image based 3D modelling is based on voxel carving with photo consistency check. Experimental results show that our proposed interaction methodology using a new solution of 3D eye tracking can be successfully applied for useful tools in context aware applications and improve its usability.},

  abstract = {AbstractWhile chatbots have become an important part of customer service operations, there is a knowledge gap concerning organizational aspects of chatbot implementation and management. In response to this gap, we present a study of organizational factors affecting successful chatbot implementation. The study involved six organizations that had implemented chatbots for customer service within the last three years. Interviews were conducted with chatbot project owners, managers, developers, and customer service personnel -- a total of 14 interviews. Through thematic analysis, five organizational factors were detailed as important for successful chatbot implementation: (1) work and team organization, (2) change management, (3) competencies and competency acquisition, (4) organizational resources, and (5) performance measures. We also present findings on the organizations' motivations and key success criteria for chatbot implementation. Based on the findings we summarize implications for theory and practice and point out directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Experience influences actions people take in protecting themselves against phishing. One way to measure experience is through mental models. Mental models are internal representations of a concept or system that develop with experience. By rating pairs of concepts on the strength of their relationship, networks can be created through Pathfinder, showing an in-depth analysis of how information is organized. Researchers had novice and expert computer users rate three sets of terms related to phishing. The terms were divided into three categories: prevention of phishing, trends and characteristics of phishing attacks, and the consequences of phishing. Results indicated that expert mental models were more complex with more links between concepts. Specifically, experts had sixteen, thirteen, and fifteen links in the networks describing the prevention, trends, and consequences of phishing, respectively; however, novices only had eleven, nine, and nine links in the networks describing prevention, trends, and consequences of phishing, respectively. These preliminary results provide quantifiable network displays of mental models of novices and experts that cannot be seen through interviews. This information could provide a basis for future research on how mental models could be used to determine phishing vulnerability and the effectiveness of phishing training.},

  abstract = {For years the HCI community has struggled to integrate design in research and practice. While design has gained a strong foothold in practice, it has had much less impact on the HCI research community. In this paper we propose a new model for interaction design research within HCI. Following a research through design approach, designers produce novel integrations of HCI research in an attempt to make the right thing: a product that transforms the world from its current state to a preferred state. This model allows interaction designers to make research contributions based on their strength in addressing under-constrained problems. To formalize this model, we provide a set of four lenses for evaluating the research contribution and a set of three examples to illustrate the benefits of this type of research.},
